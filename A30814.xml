            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that by theſe terms, which note a diſtinction, is ſignified a difference in relation, not in ſubſtance, wherein they are one; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>Filius ad ſe Deus vocatur, ad Patrem Filius;</hi> the Son in reſpect of himſelf, is called God; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Father, he is called Son; in reſpect of ſubſtance, they have the ſame beginning, in relation the Father is the beginning of the Son. I conclude this, with that ſaying of the forementioned Father, <hi>Non poſſum unum cogitare, quin trium fulgore circumfundor, nec tria poſſum diſcernere, quin ſubito ad unum referor.</hi> I cannot think upon the
<pb facs="tcp:62988:5"/> Unity, but I am every way confounded with the brightneſs of the Trinity; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I diſcern the Trinity, but I am ſuddenly brought back to the Unity.</p>
            <p>Now this one <hi>God is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in Spirit and truth, John 4. 24.</hi> He hath being from himſelf, to diſtinguiſh him from all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have a communicative being; he is full of all perfections, whereas eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature hath ſome perfection in him which another hath not, he hath ſimply all which may be had: Moreover, the beſt perfections of the creatures, do fall ſhort of his perfections, both becauſe they are infinite, and uncapable of any defects; the creatures be they never ſo exact, yet are they capable of defects; as a glaſs in a mans hand, though it be not broken, yet it is weak, and ſubject to be broken.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>God</hi> (as to his Nature) he is ſimple, there is no compoſition of parts in him, neither doth he come into compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with his creatures: He is infinite in duration, which is his Eternity; infinite in Eſſence, which is his Immenſity; his

I ſhall not inſiſt upon theſe things, becauſe the enſuing Treatiſe will furniſh you with particular apt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Attributes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now Right Worſhipful, and much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Sir, I humbly dedicate this firſt
<pb facs="tcp:62988:6"/> Part of the deſcription of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Attributes,</hi> unto your Self, and worthy Lady: To you, Sir, above all others, I commend the Patronage of this Treatiſe, as being now Patron of that place where the Worthy and Learned Authour (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto by your Renowned Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, <hi>Sir Richard Wilbraham</hi>) exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed his Miniſtry with good ſucceſs for divers years, to whom alſo your Worſhip was (as I have been informed) a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenas. The ſcope of this Treatiſe will lead you to the knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> the unity of the Divine Eſſence, and the Trinity of the Perſons ſubſiſting in the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. We cannot worſhip <hi>God</hi> aright, without ſome knowledge of this glorious and incomprehenſible Truth, becauſe the Trinity of Perſons, <hi>God</hi> the Father, <hi>God</hi> the Son, and <hi>God</hi> the Holy Ghoſt, are both the object of our worſhip, and of our faith. <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee to be the only true God, and him whom thou haſt ſent, Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. We are baptized in the Name of the Three Perſons, which layeth an indiſpenſable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb facs="tcp:62988:7"/> upon all Chriſtians to know them in ſome meaſure.</p>
            <p>There is a four-fold knowledge, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther four Properties or Qualifications of the knowledge of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A meer notional, or ſpeculative knowledge of God, a knowledge which is only in the brain, and reacheth not the heart; like the Moon, which giveth light, but no warrnth to inferiour bodies. A man may (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) have all this knowledge, and yet his knowledge may profit him nothing; this makes men great Scholars, but not good Chriſtians, and ſome great Scholars are but Dunces in Chriſtianity. The deepeſt Philoſopher that ever was (ſaving the reverence of the Schools) is but a Sot to the ſimpleſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian that hath the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt; yet we are all to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this ſpeculative knowledge, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to ſaving knowledge without a natural apprehenſion: Speculation is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to practice, but meer Speculation will not ſerve our turn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a practical and ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb facs="tcp:62988:7"/> knowledg which is required of us: pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice is the end of knowledg: <hi>hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments, 1 John 2. 3.</hi> And indeed knowledg without obedience may be termed ignorance of God, and Chriſt ſaith, that ſuch knowledg will greaten a mans torments in hell; <hi>he that knoweth, and doth not his maſters will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luk. 12. 47. A practical knowing Chriſtian is a more knowing man, than he that hath all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg without practice; ſome Divines give this definition of Divinity. <hi>Theologia eſt ars benè vivendi;</hi> Divinity is the art of holy living: he is a Divine Preacher that lives holily, he is a Divine Chriſtian that lives obediently.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An affectionate knowledg of God, and the things of God is requiſite to a Chriſtian: if the ſtar of knowledg doth not guid our affections to Chriſt, to love him, to deſire him, this knowledg is nothing: Chriſtian knowledg is love and delight in the perſon known to us, 'tis as the husband knows his wife, the father his child, and
<pb facs="tcp:62988:8"/> one friend knoweth another, loving and delighting in them. 'Tis a common rule: <hi>Verba ſenſus &amp; intellectûs in ſcripturâ ſempèr implicant affectum.</hi> Words of underſtanding and ſenſe imply affection. God himſelf is ſaid to know us and our ways, when he loveth and approveth of our perſons and ways, and he is ſaid not to know us, when he loves us not: in like manner we then know God, when we love him, and we cannot but love him, if we truly know him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An experimental knowledg of God, a <hi>ſcientia guſtus,</hi> as the School-men term it, a knowledg of taſte, <hi>ſapida ſcientia,</hi> a ſavoury knowledg of ſpiritual truths. <hi>O taſt and ſee that the Lord is good.</hi> Pſ. 34. 8. The more you taſte of Gods goodneſs in your hearts, the more will you love him, and delight in him, your ſouls will then reliſh nothing but God, the ſweetneſs of all creatures, pleaſures, profits, will be unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury to your ſouls; of all Chriſtians thoſe are the moſt knowing, that have taſted of ſins bitterneſs, and Chriſts ſweetneſs: he that hath once taſted of hony, doth more
<pb facs="tcp:62988:8"/> perfectly know the ſweetneſs of it, than he that hath read a thouſand books of the ſweetneſſe of it, but never taſted it. That Chriſtian that hath taſted how gracious God in Chriſt is to him, and how bitter ſin is, knows both better, than that Miniſter that hath onely read a thouſand books or that Chriſtian that hath onely heard a thouſand Sermons of both. When we preach of the ſweetneſs of God and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances to men that never had any expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledg, we do but commend dainty meats to dead pallates, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Sunne to men that are blind; knowledg in the ſoul is both the eye, and light, <hi>if the light that is in a man be darkneſs, how great is that darkneſs?</hi> Why do the Generality of the world take phancy for faith, preſumption and conceit for faith? is it not becauſe they want this light of ſaving knowledg to diſcern the right hand of faith, from the left hand of phancy and preſumption? now craving pardon for this my boldneſs, my prayer for you to God ſhall be that you may not be barren, nor unfruitful in the knowledg
<pb facs="tcp:62988:9"/> of God; and now when the World is blew with envy, green in malice, and wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in goodneſs, and when many great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons provide delitiouſly for their bellies, gloriouſly for their backs, and poorly for their ſouls; you may always be doing good, laying up in ſtore for yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words have reference to the foregoing: <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated from this earthly vale of miſery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full poſſeſſion of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly happineſ before he was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated he had communion and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with God; and now he enjoyeth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62988:10"/> eternal fellowſhip with his God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption for a moment, becauſe he had this Teſtimony, that he pleaſed God; hence I obſerve,</p>
                  <p>That there is no heavenly happineſs to be expected after death, without pleaſing God on earth. Heaven is an holy place, and will not admit rebells. <hi>Abraham's</hi> boſome is no lodging-place for unbelieving miſcreants. How came <hi>Enoch</hi> to pleaſe God? the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in this verſe; it was by faith: <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe him.</hi> By faith, I underſtand a Juſtifying faith, a fiduciall recumbency upon God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>By pleaſing God, two things are underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Approbation: By faith, <hi>Enoch</hi> was approved of God; or, <hi>Enoch</hi> did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf before God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That he was juſtified, accepted of as a righteous perſon; his faith made his perſon acceptable, and his obedience well-pleaſing: the gift ſanctifieth not the altar, but the Altar the gift; the gold
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62988:10"/> is therefore pretious, becauſe it is the gold of the Temple: the ſame may be ſpoken of our perſons and of our works: our good works make not our perſon good, but our perſon makes our works good; 'tis by faith our works are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated good: A thouſand duties and glorious works will no more benefit an unbelieving perſon, then crowns of gold and diamonds and Garlands of roſes a filthy putrifying Carcaſs: all moral perfections, how glorious and gratious ſoever to outward appearance, yet are (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls them) <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> glittering ſins, ſpeaking of moral vertues in the unbelieving Heathens: you may learn hence theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whatſoever graces are in men, yet faith is the grace which makes them the delight of Gods eyes; the Apoſtle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not one grace in <hi>Enoch,</hi> but his faith: <hi>Faith is the rich diamond in the ring of grace, 'tis the roſe of</hi> Sharon <hi>in a garland of Lillies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. All unbelieving men, what glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vertues ſoever are in them, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,

But I will further open theſe three Phraſes, and ſhall enquire.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is this coming to God. 1. By coming to God, ſome underſtand believing in God: faith is called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to God in Chriſt. No man can come unto me, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me, unleſſe the Father draw him, or raiſe him up to believe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Coming is rather meant a frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; as the chief goodneſſe and happineſ for in the following
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62988:12"/> words he ſpeaks of believing, A man muſt firſt believe that God is, and that he is a bountiful rewarder of ſuch, before he will come unto him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are to enquire the meaning of that phraſe; <hi>Muſt believe that he is.</hi> I anſwer: He muſt believe either that<note place="margin">Bez. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in loc.</note> there is a God, or els, as <hi>Beza</hi> hath it, that God is true and faithful in his free and gracious promiſes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What is meant by the other phraſe: <hi>And a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him?</hi> I anſwer <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is <hi>Beza</hi>'s obſervation, that there is mutuall relation betvveen <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p>Theſe words do much ſet out the nature of faith, as in theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Faith makes a man to ſee his wants and miſery; otherwiſe it would not ſend him a begging; it makes a man to ſee that he is without God, without
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62988:12"/> Chriſt, and ſo without all hopes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of eternal ſalvation; therefore it ſets men on work to ſeek God in Chriſt diligently, to be unſatiable and reſtleſs after Chriſt; God muſt be my God in Chriſt, or elſe I am in a reprobate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Faith emptieth a man of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in himſelf, and in the creatures, all are miſerable comforters, broken reeds and ciſterns, not a drop of Spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and heavenly hope is found in any thing. A man will never go out of himſelf to God in Chriſt, till he is knockt off from carnal confidences; the winds and waves muſt firſt beat him down, before he will lay his foundation upon the Rock.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Faith ſheweth that God is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and bountifull Rewarder of all them that put their truſt in him, and aſſureth the trembling broken-hearted Sinner, that God will be his God, if he come unto him.</p>

                  <p>NOw having thus laid open the words, I will addreſs my ſelf
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62988:13"/> to my intended ſubject; and the words that I will inſiſt upon ſhall be theſe—<hi>Muſt believe that God is;</hi> or, that there is a God.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt fundamental point of religion: A man knows and believes nothing, unleſs he firſt knows that there is a God: Can you believe the pardon of Sins, your ſalvation, your immortal glory, unleſs firſt you are perſwaded there is a God? now becauſe evermore there have been Atheiſts, and there is abundance of Atheiſm in our hearts, I will prove that there is a God, and this ſhall be the point,</p>
                  <q>That there is a God.</q>
                  <p>For this name or title of <hi>God;</hi> we muſt firſt know, it is <hi>nomen poteſtatis, &amp; commune, non proprietatis,</hi> a name of power and juriſdiction, and 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, not of propriety.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is common to the three Perſons becauſe it denoteth the divine Eſſence, which is one and the ſame in all the three perſons,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is common in this reſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62988:13"/> 
                     <hi>extenſivè,</hi> or <hi>abuſivè,</hi> it is given to the creatures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis given to Angels who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Elohim, Dij,</hi> Gods. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. 'Tis given to men <hi>Pſal. 82. I have ſaid, Ye are Gods,</hi> but ye ſhall die like men. And the reaſon is, becauſe Angels and Magiſtrates are partakers of ſome divine excellencies.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold kind of Arguments to prove there is a God: 1. <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> from the word of God, which is his own divine teſtimony of himſelf, <hi>that he is,</hi> and the <hi>ſolum objectum fidei,</hi> the onely object of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are <hi>Rational</hi> Arguments drawn from the creatures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other things, which demonſtrate there is a God; now becauſe the Atheiſt that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinketh there is no God or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whether there be a God, will as well deny the Scripture to be the Word of God, as deny God himſelf; I will deal onely in the latter kind of Arguments; and in theſe I will not meddle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the ſublime Philoſophical and Scholaſtical
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62988:14"/> reaſons, by which they demonſtrate there is a God, but bring the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar arguments, eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and ſufficient to convince; and it beſt beſeems catecheticall diſcourſe to inſtruct the ignorant.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <head>Sect. 2.</head>
                  <p>The firſt argument I bring is from<note place="margin" type="runSum">Arg. 1</note> the Creation of the world, which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifieth, that there is a God: none but a God can make ſuch a curious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick as the world. The Scripture much inſiſteth upon it, to convince men there is a God: <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> for this end to prove that there is a God, that did in the beginning cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate heaven and earth, and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in both. So <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1. 20. tells us, that <hi>the inviſible things of him from the creation of the world are clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> Theſe Viſible creatures do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the inviſible things of God, his wiſdome, omnipotency, eternity, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is ſeen in the creatures; ſo that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62988:14"/> an Ath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſt, or any man cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his eyes, and look either upward or downward, or any way, but he may ſee a thouſand preachers that there is a God: yea, the moſt deſpicable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are <hi>Doctores Theologiae:</hi> The very buzzing of a little fly, did make <hi>Pliny</hi> to confeſs the power of God.</p>
                  <p>In this one argument I ſhall uſe divers arguments; as</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The creatures did not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;<note place="margin">Plin. <hi>natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hiſt.</hi>
                     </note> therefore there was a Creatour of them, and that is God: they did not make themſelves for theſe two reaſons: for, 1. Then there would be no vile, baſe, deſpicable creatures in the world: if a worm had the making of it ſelf, it would not have made it ſelf a worm, but a more noble and more glorious creature: no; it is God, the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent potter, that took out an handfull of clay, out of the confuſed chaos, and made veſſels, ſome creatures of honour, ſome of diſhonour, according to the pleaſure of his good will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Had the creatures made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62988:15"/> there had not been ſuch an orderly ſubordination, and ſubjection of creatures to each other, and of all Creatures unto man. That the earth ſhould bring forth graſs and herbs, graſs ſhould ſerve the beaſts, and beaſts ſerve men, none but a God muſt work this ſubordination of creatures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If the creature ſhould make it ſelf, then it ſhould be before it ſelf, and after it ſelf; for the cauſe of a thing is before it's effect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the generation of man; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that beggetteth, doth not know what he begetteth; and the mother that conceiveth, doth not knovv what ſhe contriveth; therefore it is God that frameth us, and the ſexe, in our mother's womb.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This world and the creatures were not made by chance, therefore by a God: ſhouldſt thou go into a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, where is neither man nor beaſt, and behold there a ſtately Houſe, thou wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>deſt ſay; ſurely ſome man made it: ſhould you find a Triangle made in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62988:15"/> ſands, as <hi>Ariſtippus did,</hi> you would ſay, ſome body made it: but here is the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>The comely and moſt beautifull or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and harmony that is among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſheweth that chance did not make them, which is a mother of confuſion; but the wiſdome of God made all things in weight and meaſure. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding a curious picture in a frame, ſaid, <hi>Video Apellis manum hanc feciſſe,</hi> I ſee the hand of <hi>Apelles</hi> hath done this: we cannot look upon the beautiful frame of the world, but we muſt acknowledg it the admirable work of the moſt wiſe God. <hi>Interroga pulchritudinem Coeli, &amp; erit confeſſio Dei; Interroga pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem Terrae, &amp; erit confeſſio Dei; Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roga pulchritudinem Aeris &amp; Maris, &amp; erit confeſſio Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither were the creatures made by nature: but by Nature two things are underſtood, either <hi>Natura naturans,</hi> and that is God: or <hi>Natura naturata,</hi> which is nothing elſe but the courſe of things: This could not create.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62988:16"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe we ſee ſome things which come not from nature; as, heroicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If by nature; then the natural courſes of things ſhould not be hindred; but they have been hindered; therefore all things were made by a ſupream Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are innumerable creatures in the world; there is a diverſity of their natures, and contrariety of creature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt creature: yet that there is ſuch an harmonious concord between them, argues there is a God that governs and over-rules all. What a difference is there between the heavens, and the earth, and ſeas? and if the creatures in their kinds, fiſh, foul, beaſts, creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, and all make but one World, there is an hand that plays upon this Inſtrument, which makes the ſtrings of divers notes to make ſuch an harmony as they do.</p>
                  <p>In a word! The whole world of creatures are a world of demonſtrative arguments to prove there is a God: ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:62988:16"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The conſideration how all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world, the upper and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſerve to one main end; <hi>ſc.</hi> the good of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The conſtant courſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the ſun knoweth his going down, <hi>Pſa. 104. 19. The ſun ariſeth and the ſun goeth down, and haſteth to the place where he aroſe. Eccl.</hi> 1. 5. The ſun is ſaid freely to run his courſe, or (which is all one) to rejoyce to run it, <hi>Pſal. 19. 5. The wind goeth toward the ſouth and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits; All the rivers run into the ſea, yet the ſea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again, Eccl.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The variety of ſeaſons, as ſpring, ſummer, harveſt, winter: Seed time and harveſt, cold and heat, ſummer and winter, day and nighr ceaſe not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 22. With theſe various ſeaſons we are alſo to conſider the particular paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in them, as rains and ſhowrs and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62988:17"/> the fruitfulneſs of the ſeaſons: Can any<note place="margin">Jer.</note> of the vanities of the Gentiles give rain? it is in vain to cry <hi>O Baal</hi> hear us: The continual preſervation and maintenance of the world; and the ordination of each ſeveral kind of creatures to their particular end; theſe things do ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently prove that there is a God. Many more arguments of this nature might be brought, but I will conclude this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that ſpeech of <hi>Hugo Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hugo. Card.</note> There is (ſaith he) a threefold voice of every creature to every man.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is <hi>Vox famulantis:</hi> they tell thee, they are thy ſervants; the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, tell thee, they are thy ſervants: they are reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and move every day to give thee light the clouds tell thee that they are carried about upon the wings of the wind to water the earth for thee: the earth tells thee, that ſhe is plowed up, and brings forth corn and graſs for thee: the beaſts tell thee, that they are for thy uſe and ſerve.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is <hi>vox admonentis,</hi> admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>Yea, every man doth acknowledg there is a God: for thoſe that are reckoned and eſteemed of for moſt profeſſed Atheiſts, yet 'tis more then probable, that they do not altogether deny a God, but onely deny that God<note place="margin">Aquinas.</note> takes any care in governing the lower and inferiour matters in the world: So <hi>Aquinas</hi> thinketh.</p>

               <p>IN the next place I ſhall lay down the grounds of Atheiſm.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, that naturall blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance of God that is in our hearts: Atheiſm is one branch that ſprouts from that curſed root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in us: when <hi>David</hi> tells us, that the fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. it followeth in <hi>ver. 2. The Lord looked down from heaven to ſee if there were any that did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62988:25"/> and ſeek God:</hi> there is a naturall Atheiſm in all, which faith and ſaving knowledge expelleth: it is through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance that carnall men have ſuch groſs conceits of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond ground is, their ſenſuall deſires of ſatisfying their baſe luſts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men give themſelves up to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and to work all manner of wickedneſſe, and would not be croſſed in their courſes, but would have an uncontroulable liberty; hence they perſwade, or (at leaſt) would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade themſelves, there is no God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis through the juſt Judgement of God upon ungodly men, that they are given over to ſuch thoughts that there is no God; for when men ſhall labour to quench the light of Nature; and, although the inviſible God be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in his works, yet will not they acknowledge him, but even wilfully ſtudy to be Atheiſts, God bereaves them of the thoughts and notions of God, and inflicts upon them a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind, that they ſhall not retain him in their thoughts.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62988:25"/>
               <p n="4">4. The impunity of wicked men makes Atheiſts: becauſe they ſin, and go unpuniſhed, ſin againſt God, and againſt Heaven, and no wrath and vengeance is revealed from Heaven upon them; hence they flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Atheiſticall thoughts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is no God, or that God is blind, and either ſees not, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard's not, what is done here below:<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 21.</note> or elſe <hi>they think that God is altogether ſuch a one as themſelves;</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering there is a day of the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the righteous judgement of God coming upon them, when vengeance ſhall be paid; and not conſidering the drops of Divine vengeance that have already fallen upon ſome Atheiſticall perſons like to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A ſeared and hardened Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is another cauſe of practicall A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm: becauſe they feel no workings of conſcience, no gripes, nor accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of conſcience, no fears nor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours as others, but live in the habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all practice of notorious ſins, publique
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62988:26"/> and private, and conſcience is dead within them in regard of it's operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; hence it is, that fools ſay in their heart, that there is no God: and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God and Conſcience let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, they throw the rains upon their necks, do live moſt abominably, and fill up the meaſure of their ſins, and treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath; God abhorrs them, and gives them up to their luſts, and reſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'Tis moſt true, ſaith the Apoſtle; There be many that are called Gods, and were worſhipped as Gods: as in heaven they worſhipped ſun, moon, and ſtarrs; in earth men, as <hi>Jupiter, Saturn,</hi> their Images; in the Sea, <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;</hi> under the earth, <hi>Rhadamanthus</hi> and <hi>Proſerpina:</hi> but all theſe are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; they are the vanities of the Gentiles; theſe many Gods and Lords cannot make up one God or Lord; they are all ſeigned Gods.</p>

                  <note place="margin" type="runSum">Arg. 1.</note> theſe arguments are able to evince.</p>
               <p>Becauſe there can be but one moſt perfect Being; therefore of neceſſity but one <hi>God,</hi> who is eſſentially and originally perfect, the very fountain of all good, and the perfection of all created beings: <hi>God</hi> is <hi>ſolus omnia,</hi> therefore moſt perfect, therefore but<note place="margin">There's none good but God <hi>verè, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectè ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè; ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter.</hi>

               <p>If there ſhould be more Gods then one, then there ſhould be a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of excellencies, there would be ſome perfection in one God which is not in the other; ſo each of them would be imperfect, neither ſhould be God, becauſe each imperfect; for there is no imperfection in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; an imperfect God is no God.</p>
               <p>Becauſe that which hath Being from<note place="margin" type="runSum">Arg. 2.</note> himſelf, and is an abſolute independent Being, can be but one; now God hath an abſolute independent Being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore he calls himſelf <hi>Jehovah:</hi> which implies two things for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> that he hath being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and gives being to all other things: <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> Act. 17. and <hi>of him are all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that there is, and can be but one Being from himſelf, this reaſon may evince, becauſe otherwiſe there would be <hi>progreſſus in infinitum:</hi> if God's Being be from another, then that which gave God his being ſhould be God, and that had his being from

               <p>There are other Heretiques, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Tritheitae,</hi> who held there were three Gods, and that upon this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62988:38"/> ground, becauſe there were three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and each perſon is very God: this errour ariſeth from the ignorance of this, in that they conſider not, that though the three Perſons are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct, yet are they but one and the ſelf ſame glorious Being and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: I hope there is none that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me, that thinketh the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in holy Trinity, to be three gods really diſtinct.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Heathen have worſhipped many gods, and becauſe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ny errours have ſprung from thence; I will draw theſe uſeful Conſiderations from the Premiſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may ſee in them the moſt horrible pollution of nature by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſtrong and ſtrange proneneſſe of mans heart naturally to idolatry, and to make many Gods. How can we but wonder to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how reaſonable Man ſhould be ſo beſotted, blinded and ſtupefied, as to fall down before ſtocks and ſtones, beaſts and clouts, and worſhip them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62988:39"/> for gods? Hence God compareth them to Oxen and Aſſes, yea makes them more brutiſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may ſee hence the full ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of having the holy Scriptures, which are Gods own Teſtimony of himſelf, as he is, and how many gods there are, or rather that there is but one God, the onely living and true God: Then what a mercy is it, to have the ſcriptures read and diligently prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among us? Why did the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles like blind Sodomites, go feeling and groping after God (as they for <hi>Lot</hi>'s door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) if haply they might find him, and therefore took creature's for God; but becauſe they had not the light of the Word to diſcover the one glorious God to them? So how comes it to paſſe that Papiſts are kept under ſpiritual darkneſſe, and in an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip: this is one reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are kept from reading the Scriptures in the mother-tongue. The Pſalmiſt makes the word of God to be the greateſt bleſſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62988:39"/> 20. <hi>He ſheweth his word unto Jacob, his Statutes and his Judgments unto</hi> Iſrael; <hi>he hath not dealt ſo with any nation, and as for his Judgments they have not known them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of fooliſh reaſonings about the Godhead, I mean about the Unity of the Godhead, and of thy fooliſh conceits, how three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons can be but one God; theſe fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh reaſonings were the ground of the hereſie of the <hi>Tritheites,</hi> as, How can three perſons being very God, make one God? The beſt anſwer unto all ſuch thoughts about the unity of the Godhead, is, to hold to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: God in his word hath given this teſtimony, that there is but one God; I will believe no more Gods, becauſe God hath ſaid, There is but one God: I will acknowledg no more; His own teſtimony is the very ground why I will believe and acknowledg but one God. Take this for a rule, when once a man departs from the word of <hi>God,</hi> he expoſeth himſelf to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62988:40"/> an hundred errors: What the <hi>German</hi> Proverb is concerning a Lie, is true of all errors, Nothing is more fruitful, one error begetteth another.</p>

               <p>If the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> were upon Earth, and did know what divine worſhip is given to her, and how the Papiſts pray to her as to a God, ſhe would with all zealous indignation ſay unto them; Worſhip God, I can do you no good; ſo would all the Saints and Angels ſay,

The ſecond witneſs is <hi>the Word</hi>] that is, the eternall Son of God: The Son of God hath many titles in the Scripture, and this is one, he is called <hi>The Word:</hi> many of the Antients en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to give reaſons of this title; but among all I will give but this one: he is called the <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is the main ſubject of the Oracles of God, and of the whole Word: <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and Apoſtles do all preach Chriſt: our Saviour himſelf ſaith of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he wrote of him. <hi>Joh. 5. 45.

               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>Chriſt bears record of himſelf:</hi> his teſtimony of himſelf are his own words and Miracles; how hath he teſtified to the World, that he came <hi>to call Sinners to repentance, to ſeek and ſave that which is loſt, and whoſoever beleeveth on him ſhould have, or, hath life everlaſting.</hi>

               <p>HEnce I note; that in the Unity<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſerv.</note> of the Divine Eſſence there is a Plurality of perſons: or, There are three perſons, but one God. For proof hereof; whereas it is ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. that <hi>In the begining the Lord made heaven and earth;</hi> Some gather the myſtery of the Trinity from theſe words <hi>Elohim Bara. Elohim</hi> is in the plural number denoting the Trinity of perſons; and <hi>Bara,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>created</hi> is the ſingular number to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the unity of eſſence: Many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are brought to prove the Trinity from theſe words, as firſt, It were incongruous to put a word of the plural before a verb of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number. 2. Becauſe whom <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> calls here <hi>Elohim,</hi> he afterward calls <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is the name of the Trinity. 3. Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ignorant of the Trinity; would not ſilence it.</p>
               <p>But others, though they approve of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62988:48"/> this as a pious and probable collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet upon better arguments think the Myſtery of the Trinity cannot be collected from theſe words: their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Elohim</hi> being put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, may ſignifie four or five perſons as well as three, leſs or more; ſo there may be occaſion given of making more or leſſe perſons, as well as three.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe if <hi>Elohim</hi> ſignifie the Trinity here, it ſhould ſignifie the Trinity in all other places of Scripture, but it doth not; and the placing of of it in the plural number with the verb in the ſingular is uſual in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prure without a Myſtery, as <hi>Geneſ. 9. 15. Exod. 2. 3. Joſ.</hi> 24. 19. Some ſay, 'tis put in the plural number <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reverentiae amplitudinem,</hi> becauſe the Majeſty, power, wiſdome, goodneſs of God is manifeſted in the creation.</p>
               <p>Others would gather it from thoſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. <hi>And God ſaid, Let Us make man in our Image, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Our likeneſs,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:62988:49"/>
               <p>Others again, gather the Myſtery of the Trinity from the unanimous cry of the Seraphims, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 3. they cry <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty;</hi> therefore (ſay they) the word [<hi>holy</hi>] is trebled in relation to the Trinity, to the three Perſons. But theſe are not plain and evident proofs of the Trinity. <hi>Holy, holy, holy,</hi> is tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled here, principally for theſe reaſons:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew that the Angels do continually praiſe God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew that the Seraphims do praiſe God with all vehemency and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſhew the infinite Perfection of his holineſſe, that the tongues of Seraphims and Angels cannot expreſs his holineſſe.</p>
               <p>There are more plain proofs of the plurality of perſons in the Godhead. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. there is a clear revelation of the Trinity: the Father ſpeaks from heaven; the Son is incarnate, and is baptized; the holy Ghoſt deſcendeth in the ſhape of a Dove. Moreover,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62988:49"/> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. the Commiſſion that our Saviour gives to his diſciples runs thus: <hi>Go teach all nations, Baptizing them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> baptizing them, <hi>tanquam in nomen unius veri Dei.</hi> It plainly ſheweth, that there are three perſons in the Deity, and that theſe are but one God. To be baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name, is, to be bound to believe and obey, and worſhip this one God, the Trinity in the Unity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 26. Theſe three are one. <hi>John</hi> 17. 22.</p>

               <p>I Will now ſet down ſome Rules, which will much help us for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of this Myſtery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The divine Nature is not a fourth thing diſtinguiſhed from the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but is the ſame with the three.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62988:52"/>
               <p n="2">2. Hence each perſon is very God, becauſe the Divine Eſſence is the ſame in each Perſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence you may ſee that there is but one God, although there be Three Perſons; becauſe they are one with the Eſſence, which is God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Hence you may ſee, that all the Attributes given to the Eſſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to every Perſon; the Father Almighty, the Son Almighty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is but one Will in them, one Underſtanding, becauſe there is but one Eſſence.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Hence all their works <hi>ad extra ſunt indiviſa,</hi> all their works outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are undivided, becauſe the Three Perſons are undivided in Eſſence. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and Providence in One, are the actions of all Three.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence the Son and the Holy-Ghoſt are God by themſelves, not by the Father. Some ſay, that the Eſſence is communicated from the Father to the Son, and from both to the Holy-Ghoſt; and ſo they are not <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p n="8">8. Hence they are one in another, the Father is in the Son, the Son in the Father, and both in the Holy-Ghoſt; they are ſtill glorifying and delighting one in another.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Theſe three Perſons in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Eſſence are not confuſed, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, or imaginary, but are really ſubſiſting and diſtinguiſhed.</p>

               <p>The Love of the Trinity appeareth in two ſpecial things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Love of the Father, the firſt Perſon in the Trinity, appeareth, in that he is become our Almighty and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Father in Chriſt.

In that being equal with God, very God would become very Man, by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of our nature, <hi>like unto us in all things, ſin onely excepted,</hi> for our ſalvation. 2. In that he is our Almighty and Eternal Saviour, to

               <p n="3">3. The Love of the Holy Ghoſt appeareth, in that he is become our ſanctifier, the Almighty and Eternal Comforter of all the godly: What comfort ſhall or can they want, who have an infinite Comforter?</p>
               <p>Their Love alſo appeareth in their joynt-actions in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that they will make all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers one with them, according to the Prayer of our Saviour for all the Faithful, <hi>Joh. 17. 21. That they all may be one, as thou, O Father, art in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62988:55"/> me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us; and the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one; I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> Verſ. 22, 23. That they may be one in the participation of glory and happineſs with the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the glorious Trinity do pour forth all good things upon the Elect; he excepteth not his own glory and happineſ and the happineſs of God the Father, is the fruition of God the Son and Holy Ghoſt: So ſhall the happineſs of all believers be the full Viſion and Fruition of this glorious God, they ſhall delight in God to all Eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>Take heed then, O ye wicked of the earth, how ye do harm the Saints of God; their Father, their Saviour, their Comforter, will judge and avenge their wrongs: you cannot long wrong and oppreſs them, becauſe God is their Father; Sin and Devils cannot damn them, becauſe the Eternal Son of God is their Saviour; you ſee they can rejoyce in tribulation, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt is their Comforter.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62988:57"/> us, that do profeſs three Perſons and one God, to give all honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to this Trinity in unity; to put all our delight in glorifying this one God, with one mind and heart, and with all our hearts and ſouls.

               <p>From the whole verſe thus explained; we may draw two conſiderable uſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may behold a ſtrong ground<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe.</note> of confidence and faith in Chriſt, we have it in that this glorious Trinity

               <p n="2">2.

According to the preſence of the ſun ſo is the light continued in the air; if the Sun withdraws his light, then darkneſs covereth the earth, becauſe light in the air ſubſiſteth by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the ſun: ſo becauſe our life, health, ſtrength, and all the comforts we do enjoy, do depend on God, and ſubſiſt by him; according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence they ſtand; if he withdraw they ſoon fall: when the ſea floweth, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſwell, when the ſeas ebb the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers fall: ſo it is with creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſence or abſence of God.</p>

And as Birds do flye from this tree to that tree, ſo do riches from this houſe to that houſe, from this man to that man. It likewiſe ſheweth the folly of thoſe that ſet their hearts upon pleaſures, which are tranſient, and periſh in the very uſe; and of thoſe that make fleſh their arm, put confidence in friends, or in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men, ſeeing none of theſe ſubſiſt of themſelves, but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain periſh. We ſee that men do not ſubſiſt always; ſometime their wealth decayeth, ſometime their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love decayeth, ſometime their beauty decayeth: ſurely, then all thoſe that depend upon them, do decay with them: all outward things are but ſandy foundations for us to build all our hopes and comforts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: look over all the creatures, and ſee what creature can ſay, <hi>I am that

               <p>This may exhort you to truſt in the<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 2.</note> Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who onely is, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth by himſelf, who hath ſaid, <hi>He will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Now conſider theſe Motives.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> can give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and doth give being to all things; he can create peace, comforts, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, health, ſtrength, friends, grace, and every good thing: he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand loving kindneſſe, he can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand comfort and deliverance to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob;</hi> when he ſpeaks the word, all things ſhall ſubſiſt according to thy deſire: ſo then, let thy condition be what it will, if God be thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, he can proportion all things

Art thou in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours fears and doubts? God can make pardon, grace, and full aſſurance of faith to ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Becauſe God Jehovah, as he ſubſiſts and gives being, ſo he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the being and ſubſiſtence of all mercies, as far and as long as they ſhall make for thy good: he can make thy health to ſubſiſt, thy riches to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, thy ſtrength, thy friends, thy life it ſelf to ſubſiſt, all comforts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward, ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral to ſubſiſt: for it is God that bears up the world and all the creatures, and according to his will and pleaſure, ſo ſhall thy comforts ſubſiſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When outward things decay, God will ſubſiſt, God wil ſubſiſt immutably, when there is a change of conditions fals out (as all outward things are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unconſtant, and mutable) Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. When all things ſhall come to nought, friends, riches, health, ſtrength, life and all, and ſhall ſubſiſt no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in thy ſelf; then God will ſubſiſt, and make thee to ſubſiſt in eternal glory, then will he ſay, I am that I am, thy reward to eternity, thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to eternity, thy eternal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, thy eternal God.</p>
               <p>This ſheweth the happineſs of all<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 3.</note> Gods ſervants, becauſe God doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſubſiſt to direct them in all their ways, to protect them in all their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to comfort them in all their tribulations, and abundantly to reward them, though they run thorow a thouſand changes, yet the Lord ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the ſame to them, and carries them thorow as upon Eagles wings: let a chriſtians condition change, yet God will never leave him nor forſake him.</p>

                  <p>The Lord glorieth in this title, a God keeping Covenant: what! doth bind himſelf by promiſe in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? he will not fail in one condition on his part, he is circumſtantially pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual. Behold what he ſpeaks of his Faithfulneſs in keeping Covenant, <hi>Jer. 31. 35, 36. Thus ſaith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the Moon, and of the Stars for a light by night; which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth the Sea, when the waves thereof roar, the Lord of Hoſts is his name: If thoſe ordinances depart from before me, ſaith the Lord, then the ſeed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>alſo ſhall ceaſe from being a Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me for ever:</hi> That look as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, of Day and Night remain firm, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable; ſo ſhall his Promiſes and Covenant made to his Church and People, be as firm and unalterable.

Now God will perform all his promiſes, becauſe his Name is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> It is obſerved by <hi>Zanchy,</hi> that as often as God in his Prophets doth promiſe any great Mercy, or threaten any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Judgment, he makes mention of this Name <hi>Jehovah; I am the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah.</hi>

                  <p>All the works of God are but the effects of his will: 'Tis ſaid, <hi>God ſaid let there be light, and there was light: let the earth bring forth herbs, let the trees bring forth fruit, according to their kind, and they did ſo:</hi> Gods ſaying is nothing elſe but his efficacious willing of the things, and as he willed things, ſo they came to paſ ſo his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in the covenant of grace are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but his will to pardon, to ſanctifie, to comfort, to deliver to give grace and glory: let mercy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſuch a ſoul; let pardon be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd to ſuch a ſinner, let ſuch luſts be mortifyed, let ſuch deliverance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide

                  <p>The obſervable rules are theſe.</p>
                  <p>The promiſes to the Church in general are propheticall promiſes, they are prophecies as well as promiſes: ſo the accompliſhment of them is to be prayed for, it ſhall be in Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:62988:77"/>
                  <p>The Jews prayed for the comming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> long before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet he came not in the fleſh till the fulneſs of the determinate time came: no queſtion but the ſeed of <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed for the poſſeſſion of <hi>Canaan,</hi> yet no poſſeſſion till the years were expired, wherein God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give them <hi>Canaan:</hi> The Church in many ages hath prayed for the ſubverſion of the Kingdome of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, yet <hi>Babylon</hi> the great is not fallen: the Church hath likewiſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the converſion of the Jews, and the bringing in of the fulneſſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet the one is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, neither is the fulneſſe of the other brought in: yet the Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi> will make good theſe and ſuch like promiſes in his own time, then ſhall the bleſſings of the promiſes, and the prayers of all Saints fall into the Churches lap.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62988:78"/> as he knowerh to be fit for thee, not ſuch and ſuch a meaſure of grace and aſſiſtance as thou thinkeſt needful. Your heavenly Father knoweth what grace, what comfort, what aſſiſtance you moſt need: Be ſure, what the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> doth fot thee, it is for the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Lord performeth his Promiſes in his own time, not in times that we preſcribe to him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. He will give grace and mercy <hi>in a time of need,</hi>

In a time accepted have I heard thee, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee.</hi> Therefore bleſſed is the man that waiteth always; when Gods time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to dawn, then mercy ſhall ſhine forth. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did endure a long and ſore bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> did groan heavily; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> came not to deliver them, till the appointed time came.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When God's determinate time
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62988:78"/> is come, then he will be made known by his Name <hi>Jehovah:</hi> the Lord is very punctual in the obſervation of moments, days, and years: as the deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was at the end of 430. years determined before, and then <hi>Moſes</hi> came: at the fulneſs of time Chriſt came in the fleſh: ſo in the fulneſs of time, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, peace of conſcience, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and deliverance ſhall come, or whatſoever it be thou ſtandeſt in need of.

When his hour was come, then he turned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine: So, when thou art in affliction, thou prayeſt, Lord, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort now, ſend deliverance now, ſend aſſurance now; our Saviour anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, My time is not yet come; when that is come, then will I turn thy Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Wine, then be it unto thee according to thy faith.</p>

               <p>That you may get comfort by the promiſes, obſerve theſe rules.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be ſure to lay up all kinds of promiſes, we are liable to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veral wants, ſtraits, dangers, miſeries; God hath fitted ſutable promiſes, as 'tis ſaid of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe did lay up his words in her heart; ſo do thou the promiſes againſt needful times: A promiſe in thy heart in time of need, is like a friend in the Court, will ſtand thee in pretious ſtead.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Acquaint thy heart with the nature of the promiſes. 1. Labour ſtrongly to apprehend the truth and faithfulneſs of the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> in his promiſes, that they are yea and Amen, he will undoubtedly perform what he hath ſpoken, he will never go back from his word. 2. Labour to underſtand their goodneſs, let thy thoughts dwell upon the promiſe, till thou haſt found out the riddle, digg into the bowels of a promiſe, as thou wouldſt digg into the bowels of the earth for ſilver: Ignorance or weak
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62988:84"/> apprehenſions of the truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Gods all-ſufficiency and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, is the ground of diſtruſtful, wavering and unbelieving thoughts: Ignorance of the good things in the promiſes is the ground of the not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of the promiſes. 3. Labour to know to what ſpecial condition the promiſe is made, ſo thou mayſt rightly apply promiſes to thy ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al maladies, the right ſalve to thy ſore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When thou art acquainted with the nature of the promiſes, then ſet faith a work, rely upon God who is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for the accompliſhing of the promiſes to thee, do thou hold faſt by the promiſe, and hold God to his word; ſay to him as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, when he wreſtled with him, <hi>I will not let thee go till thou haſt bleſſed me;</hi> I will never let thee go, till thou haſt made good this or that promiſe to me.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Labour to get a quiet and ſtill frame of heart to wait for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Promiſes: This is to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62988:84"/> live by Faith in a Promiſe, to walk by Faith; for God will not by and by make good his Promiſes, but for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Faith, he defers execution of them. <hi>David</hi> would often call upon himſelf to wait upon the Lord, <hi>Wait on the Lord, O my ſoul;</hi> and would check himſelf for tumultuous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtful thoughts; <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? why art thou diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted within me? wait on God:</hi> for the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> will certainly in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time make good his promiſes to thee: if thou canſt live by Faith, delays will not be tedious; <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth will not make haſte,</hi> Iſa. 28. 16.</p>
               <p>If the Lord will make his Promiſes good, becauſe he is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> then<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 4.</note> anſwer all diſtruſtful and unbelieving temptations with this, God is <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah.</hi> A Believer ſhall find many ſtrong temptations to unbelief: As about the Promiſes of Juſtification, this temptation may ariſe; Can the Lord pardon ſuch a vile ſinner as I am? 'Tis true, I read how he is a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62988:85"/> God pardoning ſinners, but will he pardon me? Yes, God can pardon thee, becauſe he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and will make good all his Promiſes. So in temptations againſt perſeverance: I fear (ſaith a poor ſoul) I ſhall prove an Apoſtate, and fall away; and the Devil will be ready to ſecond it: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it by this, The Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> hath promiſed to put his fear in my heart, that I ſhall not depart from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. and he being <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> can make me to perſevere and hold out to the end.</p>

               <p>HAving briefly gone over the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Titles and Names of God, I will proceed to a plain handling of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62988:85"/> his glorious Attributes and properties. Before I come to particulars, I muſt lay down ſome general Rules for the better underſtanding of the nature of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Attributes or Properties ſhew to us, what God is in himſelf; declare him to be moſt Wiſe, moſt Holy, Good, Perfect, Infinite, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Divine Excellencies are called Attributes, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſcribes them to God; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges Him to be Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent, Omnipreſent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Gods Attributes are not acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Qualities in Him; Goodneſs, Wiſdome, Infiniteneſs, Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are his very Eſſence, not Accidents, as in creatures; Wiſdome, Goodneſs. Holineſs, Power, are qualities in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as in Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>Neither are they in God as <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>naturales,</hi> natural faculties: Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Will is in Man and Angels.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:62988:86"/>
               <p>Neither are they in God as Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Paſſions: Love is in God, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is in God, Joy is in God, not as they are in his creatures, affections, or paſſions.</p>
               <p>But all the Attributes are really the ſame with his Eſſence; therefore they are ſpoken of God <hi>in abſtracto,</hi> God is love, God is Mercy, God is Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God is Juſtice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there are many Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties attributed to God, yet all theſe Properties are not really diſtinguiſhed from each other, but they are all one and the ſame Eſſence: As when we ſay, God is infinite, God is merciful, God is powerful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are not to conceive, that his Mercy is really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from his Juſtice, his Wiſdome, really diſtinct from his Power; but as they are the ſame with the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſo they are with each other. As the Divine Eſſence is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, infinite, eternal, perfect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some Divines expreſs this by a piece of Gold: a piece of Twenty ſhillings
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62988:86"/> doth not contain in it twenty ſeveral diſtinct pieces of Silver; but 'tis one and the ſame piece which contains ſo many pieces in worth and value. So that the multitude of Attributes in God, is not in reſpect of ſo many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Excellencies really diſtinguiſhed among themſelves in God, but onely in reſpect of our manner of conceiving.</p>
               <p>Our underſtandings are unable, and too weak to apprehend all his glorious excellencies: By one act of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we cannot conceive God to be infinite, omnipotent, holy, juſt, good by one act, but by divers acts.</p>
               <p>Then again, there is not one Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſo large, as to comprehend or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his incomprehenſible and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible Being: Therefore this we ſay, the divine Properties are not ſo many really diſtinct Vertues in God; but they are that <hi>Unica Eſſentia ad omnia ſufficiens,</hi> one onely Eſſence, which is moſt merciful, moſt perfect, moſt holy, moſt powerful.</p>

               <p>And indeed 'tis all the comfort of the Godly, that whatſoever they do to God and for God, is in ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart. 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 12.

               <p>Hence it is that he abhors all hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, in whoſe heart and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances there is abundance of fraud and guil; who have (as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks) an heart and an heart, a double heart, becauſe ſuch perſons are moſt oppoſite and contrary to his moſt ſimple nature; therefore he throws away all duties of hypocrites (how glorious ſoever they are to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, to publique view) as ſo many abominations, as hateful things in his ſight, for want of ſimplicity and ſincerity of heart, which he looks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

               <p>THe Point that I will handle from theſe words, is this;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God is an Eternal God.</hi>

               <p>Here I will ſhew firſt, what <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is; then prove the Point by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon; then make Uſe of it.</p>
               <p>Eternity is taken three ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Propriè,</hi> properly: So it noteth to be without beginning and end; ſo God onely is Eternal.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Impropriè:</hi> So it noteth to have a beginning, but no ending; ſo An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, ſo the Souls of Men are eternal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Abuſivè:</hi> So ſome things are ſaid to be eternal, which have had a beginning, and ſhall alſo have an end; they are called Eternal, in reſpect of their long continuance and duration; ſo Circumciſion, and other Moſaical Ceremonies, were called Eternal or everlaſting; and the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was called an <hi>everlaſting poſſeſſion,</hi> that is, they ſhould continue for a long time.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:62988:97"/>
               <p>I am to ſpeak of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and abſolutely Eternal: That is therefore properly and abſolutely E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, which hath no beginning of his being, nor end; that is, without ſucceſſion, always the ſame.</p>
               <p>Three things are required in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it hath no beginning of his being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is no ſucceſſion or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in that being, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor after, but is always the ſame; therefore Eternity is called, <hi>Nunc per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manens,</hi> or <hi>continuans;</hi> it is the ſame from Eternity to Eternity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it hath no End of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee a vaſt difference<note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between Time and Eternity.</note> between Time and Eternity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Time hath a beginning and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Time ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In Time there is <hi>prius &amp; poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> paſt, preſent, and to come; but in Eternity, there is not <hi>praeteritio,</hi> nor <hi>futuritio,</hi> neither praeterition, nor fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Time compared to Eternity, is but a drop to the vaſt Ocean, or as a grain of Sand to the whole circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Heaven, or as a moment in reſpect of millions of millions of Ages: or elſe, Time is but as a momentany ſpace in the midſt of Eternity. There is an Everlaſting from which Time iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, there is an Everlaſting into which Time ſhall be ſwallowed up.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, when we ſpeak or think of Eternity, we rather look forward than backward; but we muſt look backward to Eternity before Time, as well as forward to Eternity after Time.</p>

               <p>NOw that God is thus Eternal, that he hath no beginning of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ending, and in him is no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, ſhall be proved by Scripture and by Reaſon.

In reſpect of his eternity after time, he is called <hi>the everlaſting God.</hi> Rom. 16. 26. <hi>An everlaſting King, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 17. That there is no ſucceſſion or priority or poſteriority in God, but is from everlaſting to everlaſting the ſame, we may ſee, <hi>Pſalm. 102. 26. 27. The heavens ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure, yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment, and as a veſture ſhalt thou change them, and they ſhall be changed, but thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end:</hi> therefore his <hi>mercy</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting, Pſal.</hi> 100. 5. he is merciful from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo to eternity: his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is everlaſting, his ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, his glory to be everlaſting, denoting there is no ſucceſſion or variation in God, but he is eternally
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62988:99"/> the ſame. The Reaſons of this point follow.</p>

That which gave Being to all<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 1.</note> that ever hath, had, or ſhall have Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is eternal, without beginning or ending: now God gave being to all that hath being: who made the worlds, even from the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the loweſt hell, with all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures contained in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 3.

Hence God is called <hi>King of ages, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 17. becauſe all times and ages of the world are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to him: and he is ſaid to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the worlds were made: Chriſt ſpeaks of himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>The</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov 8. 22. <hi>ad.</hi> 30. ver.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old, I was ſet up from everlaſting, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, or ever the earth was: when there were no depths I was brought forth,

               <p n="2">2. He that had glory and honour before the world was, and whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and purpoſes were before the world was, is eternal; but God had glory before the world was. <hi>John</hi> 17. 5. Chriſt prayeth thus unto his Father, <hi>Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> His decrees and purpoſes likewiſe

               <p n="3">3. He that had being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, is without beginning and ending: but God <hi>Jehovah</hi> had being from himſelf, and not from any other, for had he being from another, he could not be <hi>Jehovah, ens primum, ens ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutè independens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He that onely gives eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is eternal, <hi>quod efficit tale, magis tale:</hi> he that makes eternal things muſt be more eternal: the Lord onely gives eternal rewards, life eternal to believers, death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to impenitent unbelieving ſinners; only God hath the keys that opens the everlaſting doors of eternal life to ſet open for all his ſaints; he hath the keyes of everlaſting <hi>damnation, and thither ſhall unbelieving miſcreants enter.</hi>

All creatures are under his dominion, and in ſubjection to his commands now, as at firſt; there is no decay in his government nor in creatures obedience, but ſtill his will is fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his continual protection of his Church and People from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation; his Church never wanted Enemies, vowing the ruine and deſolation of her, from her foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; it hath been in all Ages like a Candle ſet upon the top of an high Hill, the bluſtring winds of malice, oppoſition, and perſecution, puſſing, blowing, and ſtorming againſt it; yet the Eternal King hath preſerved it, that they could never blow it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62988:103"/> Satan hath filled with malice againſt the Church; yet the gates of Hell could never prevail againſt it.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:62988:105"/> all his divine excellencies, being but the divine nature and eſſence, endure for ever; his glory then muſt endure for ever. God is glorified in Heaven by his Saints, becauſe his mercy endureth for ever; he is likewiſe glorified in Hell, becauſe his juſtice endureth for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

What is the reaſon that all the excellencies in the Creatures are not from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? it is becauſe they are depending, and all came from an external cauſe. Why are the Creatures and created excellencies mutable and fading? It is becauſe they depend upon that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe, and according to his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, or putting forth his influence, ſo the creatures do flouriſh or wither: But God's dominion, power, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are originally from himſelf, and not derivatively from an external
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:62988:105"/> cauſe: therefore without beginning, becauſe he had none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhall have no end, becauſe there is none can put an end to his power and dominion.</p>
               <p>'Tis by this eternal King that all earthly Kings do reign; and from him they receive honour, dominion, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and riches, and therefore at his pleaſure they ſhall caſt down their Crowns and Scepters before him: but God reigneth by himſelf, and hath his dominion, power, and glory in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and from himſelf, therefore it is from eternity to eternity.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, the thoughts of this ſhould wonderfully quicken us up to get an intereſt in this eternal and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent King of glorious ſtate. Why do ye ſpend your days in the purſuit of periſhing vanities? Suppoſe you had a Kingdome in this world, all the treaſures, riches, ſtrength, and all the glory of an earthly Kingdome; 'tis ſomewhat that would perhaps make your hearts to overflow with joy and pride, yet 'tis nothing in compariſon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:62988:106"/> of an intereſt in God. An earthly Kingdome is not for ever; earthly Princes die like ordinary men, then all their earthly honours, pleaſures, treaſures and riches die with them: the World it ſelf had a beginning, and ſo ſhall have an end, then ſhall all the glory of the world paſs away: but God is for ever, his Kingdome, power and glory are eternal; therefore in getting an eternal God, you ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an eternal Kingdome, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory.</p>
               <p>Be you Judges, whether it be not better to be godly, how miſerable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for the preſent, and to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy in the enjoying of an eternal God for ever; or to be rich, potent, and glorious in this preſent world, and to be deſtroyed from the preſence of God for ever. Lay to heart theſe things: Thy time is draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nigh, when all thy worldly pomp, power, riches, honour, credit, eſteem among the Rich in the world will be at an end; if you neglect a diligent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62988:106"/> ſeeking after an eternal good, what will ye do when your power and glory, and eſteem, and riches ſhall fail, and you have no intereſt in this God of eternal power and glory? Wo unto you, when you ſhall be thrown out of the world, ſhut out of the Kingdom of God, and be both thrown and trodden down for enemies into the burning priſon, to ſuffer the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting vengeance of the eternal King of glory.</p>

               <p>I Shall now lay down ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove that God is infinite and incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If God were not incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 1.</note> then there may be ſomething which is <hi>extra Deum,</hi> beyond, or above, or without God, which hath not his being in God: but theſe places of Scripture manifeſt, nothing can be above or beyound God. <hi>Pſal. 139. 7. ad</hi> 12. ſheweth, that there is no flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God's preſence, and that no creature can be where God is not; <hi>Job 11. He is higher then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God were not infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 2.</note> then there would be ſomething that is an adequate meaſure of his greatneſs: If there be any ſuch meaſure of his greatneſs, then it ſhould be the Heaven of heavens, which is of the largeſt capacity, ſeeing it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth within it's compaſs, the whole created world; but this is not the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62988:112"/> meaſure; for behold, <hi>the heaven of heavens cannot contain him:</hi> he is higher than the heavens, deeper than the earth,</p>
               <p n="3">3. If God were not infinite, but<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 3.</note> finite, then 'tis poſſible, that God might move from place to place, as finite bodies may.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If God were not infinite, then<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 4.</note> it is poſſible for us to conceive ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be greater than God; but it is impoſſible for the underſtanding of Men or Angels to conceive a thing may be greater than God: See in what manner the Prophet prayeth to God, and then tell me, whether we can conceive any thing greater than he? Jer. 32. 17, 18, 19. <hi>Ah Lord God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou haſt made the heaven and the earth by thy great power, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-out arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee. Thou ſheweſt loving kindneſs to thouſands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The great, the mighty God, the Lord of hoſts is his name: Great in counſel, and mighty in working. For thine eyes are open upon
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62988:112"/> all the ways of the ſons of men, to give every one according to his ways, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fruit of his doings.</hi> He is called, <hi>the bleſſed and onely Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; Who onely hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath ſeen, nor can ſee; to whom be honour, and power everlaſting, Amen. 1 Tim.</hi> 6. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Now theſe three things may fully evince, that God is infinite and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God is abſolutely and eminently perfect; not ſo much as a negative imperfection is in God: All perfections are his eſſence, or rather his eſſence is all perfections; all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power, infinite mercy, infinite juſtice, infinite wiſdom; therefore he is called, <hi>Pelagus eſſentiae,</hi> a ſea of being, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>We may behold great perfection in the creatures; Angels are great in power, great in wiſdome: but all the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62988:113"/> perfections that are in creatures, are but as a drop of a bucket in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the main Ocean, they are as nothing.</p>

Turn thou from thy wicked ways, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and prove whether the Lord will not pour down mercies, that there ſhall not be room enough to receive them; God will abundantly pardon: <hi>For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,</hi> ſaith the Lord; <hi>For as the Heavens are higher then the earth, ſo are my ways higher then your ways, and my thoughts

Will God be gracious to ſuch a vile wretch as I am? Thou haſt ſaith God, too ſhallow thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me: my thoughts are not like thine; thy thoughts of my way of mercy are but finite poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, but my thoughts of love and mercy to broken hearted ſinners that humble themſelves unfeignedly, are (like my ſelf) infinite: I have infinite thoughts of mercy toward you, I have infinite thoughts of mercy for you; <hi>for as the heaven is higher then the earth, ſo are my ways higher then your ways, and my thoughts higher then your thoughts.

               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:62988:115"/>
               <p n="3">3. If God be an infinite majeſty;<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 3.</note> this may ſerve as an uſe of inſtruction to us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then it concerns us, to behave our ſelves with all humility and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence when we draw nigh to God: by how much greater a prince is, the more reverence we ſhew to him: God is great, infinite majeſty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of all fear, ſubmiſſion, and reverence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Angels in heaven cover their faces ſtanding in His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.

               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:62988:116"/>
               <p n="2">2. It inſtructeth us, what a moſt noble ſervice Gods ſervice; is; the greater the Perſon is, the more noble is his ſervice; it is far more noble to ſerve Kings than to be a keeper of ſheep; God is a great King, an infinite majeſty, infinitely exceeding all the Majeſty and ſtate of earthly Kings; to ſerve him then, and to be his favourite, is far more noble than to ſerve Kings and Emperours: <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> thanked God more that he was a Chriſtian, than an Emperour; there's no title in compariſon of this, to be the ſervant of the great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God. Great perſonages can give great gifts to their ſervants; but God will give infinite, eternal rewards to all his faithfull ſervants, not the half of his Kingdome, but his kingdome to his ſervants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If God be infinite; it further<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 4.</note> teacheth us three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this great God ſhould have all our affections pitch upon him, root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed in him; he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:62988:116"/> of all poſſible love, poſſible fear, poſſible joy: we may over-love all things except God, we may over-love our own ſelves, our wives, our children, the creatures, and ſin great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in loving them, but we cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-love God: he is incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in reſpect of our love to him, as well as in our conceiving of him: God is worthy of more love, than your hearts are capaple of love. The Angels and bleſſed Saints burn with Love, and ſhall burn with love to him to all eternity, and yet they ſhall never love him enough: God is infinitely good, infinitely glorious, and therefore deſerveth infinite love; and indeed none love God with a comprehenſive love but himſelf. If ye were the ſons of a Father who is infinitely wiſe, infinitely powerful, infinitely bleſſed and glorious, how would your natural love be toward him; ſuch a one is the Lord our God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It teacheth us whether we ſhould
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:62988:117"/> go for ſatisfaction, even to God who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

'Tis God that is infinite, that fills Heaven, he can fill our hearts with all deſirable and poſſible good: The whole ſoul will be ſatisfied with God; he will fill the underſtanding with knowledge, as he is infinite in wiſdom; he will fill the will and affections with good, as he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good: The eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hearing, nor the heart with deſiring, becauſe when a man hath ſeen and heard many things, God will ſatisfie both ear, eye and heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſheweth the wretched madneſs of moſt men, who ſpend all their thoughts, time, affections and labour about poor finite tranſitory things, as worldly Glory, Honours, Riches, &amp;c.
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62988:117"/> and neglect God, and embrace theſe ſhadows, theſe dreams, before an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite God, in whom is infinite Glory, Honour, Riches; who is an infinite trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all perfections: If God be thy portion, then haſt thou infinite Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Riches, becauſe thou haſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God; if thou enjoyeſt the world, and haſt a world of Honours, of Riches, and all worldly Goods, and haſt no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in God, nor right to him; thou art infinitely poor, wretched and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.

Are ye not aſhamed to ſpeak openly what your hearts do meditate upon? and are ye not aſhamed then to lodge ſuch thoughts in Gods preſence, who is and will be a Witneſs and a Judge of your thoughts? A vain mind is a very Atheiſtical mind; he that is proud in his thoughts, Adulterous in his thoughts, is a very Atheiſt in his mind: God doth in effect ſay to every ſinner, I am God, and know your thoughts, and will judge your thoughts; I can ſee the world in thy thoughts; I can ſee pleaſures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> profits, vanities in thy thoughts; I can ſee thy Whores, thy cups, thy companions in thy thoughts,

               <p n="1">1. He knows all things that are paſt, as if they were now preſent: <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90. 8. All thy ſins ſecret and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, long agoe committed are before God, as if they were now in acting, thy adultery, thy oathes, thy drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe committed 10. or 20. years agone: <hi>Thou haſt ſet our iniquities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. God knoweth all creatures, all things preſent: here I ſhall ſpeak eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of his knowledg in reference to man.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:62988:141"/> 1. He knows all our works, there is nothing thou canſt do, or doſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the light or in the dark, in cloſets or in the houſe tops; but he knows it. <hi>Rev. 3. 1.

                  <hi>They are a people that do erre in their hearts,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 10. God knows all the thoughts of our hearts, how momentany, ſuddain and tranſient ſoever they be; though they come in, and go out again in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, yet he knows and obſerves them all: <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity. Pſal. 94. 11. Job.</hi> acknowledgeth this to God. <hi>I know that thou canſt do every thing, and that no thought is with-holden from thee. Job.</hi> 42. 2. He knoweth all the imaginations of man's heart. <hi>God ſaw that the wickedneſs of man was great upon earth, and that every imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually, Gen.</hi> 6. 5. The Lord likewiſe knoweth all the purpoſes and intentions, and counſels of the heart; he knoweth what your aimes are in all your undertakings; whether you intend his glory, or your own ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, his word is <hi>a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:62988:142"/> Heb.</hi> 4. 12. When the <hi>Jews</hi> came with queſtions to Chriſt, as if they deſired to be informed by him, our Saviour knowing their thoughts, knew that they came to entrap him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord knoweth all the words that we ſpeak. <hi>There is not a word in my tongue, but loe, Oh Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether. Pſal.</hi> 139. 4. The Lord knows every idle word that you ſpeak, and will one day bring you to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. He hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a book of remembrance to ſet down every good word, that they that fear the Lord ſpeak one to another. <hi>Malach.</hi> 3. 16.</p>

               <p n="1">1. God beholdeth all things <hi>uno in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitu,</hi> by one ſimple act, not by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, as Angels and Men do; he knoweth all things <hi>intuitivè,</hi> not <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſivè,</hi> or <hi>ſucceſſivè,</hi> as a man may ſee many particular objects at once that lie before him: but God ſees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite objects intuitively at once, and therefore all things are ſaid <hi>to be before</hi> him, even things paſt, and things to come: there is no <hi>praeterition</hi> nor <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition</hi> in God's Knowledg (to ſpeak properly) for all things are preſent before him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God knoweth all things <hi>moſt perfectly</hi> and <hi>evidently,</hi> not in part, or
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:62988:143"/> obſcurely, as men do: but he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things fully and exactly; his knowledg is a perfect knowledg, that cannot be increaſed or diminiſhed.

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>THere are many Reaſons may be given to prove God is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:62988:144"/>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe God created all things;<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 1.</note> therefore no creature is hid from him, but is open and naked before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all are the works of his hands. Now the Rule is this, <hi>Agentes cum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilio,</hi> thoſe Agents that do work with counſel, do know all their works; and what Agent worketh with counſel, if the moſt wiſe God doth not? He makes all things with moſt deliberate and wiſe counſel: ſo then for the things themſelves, God doth fully know them, making them by his knowledg and wiſe counſel; he knoweth thee likewiſe, unleſs thou wilt deny thy ſelf to be his Creature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe there is no action which<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 2.</note> any creature doth, but God cooperates and concurreth with and in the action: <hi>God</hi> enableth natural cauſes to produce natural actions; contingent cauſes to produce contingent actions; free and voluntary agents to produce free and voluntary actions: You cannot think a thought, you cannot ſpeak a word, you cannot do an action without God:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:62988:144"/>
'Tis the Lord enableth you to lie down, to riſe up; or whatſoever any man doth, the Lord enables him to do it; yea, no wicked man can commit ſin, act ſin, either in ſecret, or in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, if God did not uphold him in the act; every action, as it is an action, is from God, but the ſinfulneſs or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it is from the Devil, or our ſelves: the Drunkard could not go to an Ale-houſe, nor the Adulterer to the houſe of the ſtrange woman, if God did not uphold them in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motions; in Him, the worſt ſinner liveth, moveth, and hath his being, even in the worſt action that he goes about: Therefore God muſt needs know all, becauſe God doth not concurr with the creature ignorantly or raſhly, but with knowledge and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God muſt neceſſarily know all<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 3.</note> things, becauſe there is nothing done but what God did fore know, and from eternity decree ſhould come to paſs: All his decrees are acts of the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:62988:145"/> Underſtanding and Will of God; but God did decree what ſhould be: God knoweth he can make a thouſand Worlds, and many thouſand Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more than he hath made, onely God decrees to make but ſo many, who took an handful of clay out of the infinite maſs, and made this world: So there is no action of any creature, but God hath decreed it, as it is an action; therefore he muſt needs fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know it. There is not a thought in thy mind, nor a word in thy tongue, nor an action of thy hand, but comes within rhe compaſs of God's decree; therefore he is ſaid to know our thoughts afar off: and the ſame may be ſaid concerning his knowledg of our words and actions, yea, every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all thy actions, what words, or what thoughts, at ſuch a time, of ſuch an object; therefore he muſt needs know all things altogether.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God doth order, guide, direct,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 4.</note> all creatures, and their actions, to ſome determinate end; therefore he muſt
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:62988:145"/> needs know all things, otherwiſe he could not guide and direct them: He guides and governeth all the inanimate creatures, and all the brutiſh creatures to their proper particular ends: Yea, when the World ſeemeth to be all out of order, the courſe of nature to be in a confuſion, God wiſely guideth tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and confuſions to a good end. God doth order, guide, and direct the ſins of wicked men, therefore he muſt needs know all their ſins; he prefixeth a time how long they ſhall ſinne; the number of their ſins, the meaſure of their ſins; therefore he muſt needs know all their ſins, he could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe guide, direct, limit, permit, reſtrain them; wicked men cannot ſin when they pleaſe, nor do what they liſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe God's underſtanding is<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 5.</note> infinite, <hi>intenſivè &amp; extenſivè:</hi> His underſtanding is his own Eſſence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt know infinite objects, which could not be if he did not know all things, every particular individual object that is or can be. <hi>Whither ſhall
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:62988:146"/> I go from thy Spirit,</hi> ſaith <hi>David?</hi> Pſal. 139. 7. that is, from Gods underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo Spirit is taken there: I can go no where, but God will know where I am, what I do, think or ſpeak; in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in Hell, at the uttermoſt part of the earth, in dark or lightſom places; Gods Spirit is there, he underſtandeth and knoweth what thou and I do.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again we may draw a Reaſon from two Inſtances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God knoweth what every man doth in publique or ſecret, may appear by the griping accuſations of our own Conſciences, bringing to mind our old tranſgreſſions, acted a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s theſe to the eye of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences? And what is the language of our Conſcience, but God will judge thee for theſe things?</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:62988:146"/>
               <p n="2">2. Again, God manifeſteth the knowledge of all our counſels, plots, and ſecret devices, becauſe he often turneth the malicious counſels of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh <hi>Achitophels,</hi> into their own ſhame and deſtruction: 'Tis God that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the thoughts of men to be vanity, and turneth their thoughts into vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their wiſdom into folly, their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous plots into their own downfall and deſtruction; he takes the wiſe in their own craft. God did reveal to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> what the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would do to him, and how <hi>Saul</hi> would follow him to <hi>Keilah,</hi> and ſo diſappointed them; this is a moſt pregnant Argument of <hi>Gods Omniſciency:</hi> When wicked men ſit and take counſel together, againſt the Lord, and his Anointed, God ſits in Heaven, and laughs them to ſcorn.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Becauſe without knowledge of<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 7.</note> all particulars of our thoughts, words and actions, with all their circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, God, who is the juſt Judge of all the world, cannot give righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God hath ſaid, That <hi>he will
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:62988:147"/> judge every man according to his works,</hi> which he cannot, did not he know the actions of men good and evil, with all their circumſtances: <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Men ſhall give an account of every idle word,</hi> then God muſt know every word altogether that we ſpeak. In the laſt day God will judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of mens hearts; how can he judge thee for thy ſecret thoughts and intents, and aims, if the Lord did not know thy thoughts, every particular action of thy mind, though they paſs away in thy mind in a moment? Gods judgment is infallible; if he did not know all; he may be deceived, and we might hide many things from God. Gods judgment is true; did not he know all things, he would not know how to judge men either to eternal death, or eternal life. Gods judgment ſhall be perfectly proportionable to the good or evil actions of men: How can he render proportionable vengeance to wicked men, and render to every man according to his works, if he did not
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:62988:147"/> know all particulars. Gods judgment will be publique in reſpect of bringing to light all ſecret wickedneſſes, and all ſecret duties; and this he could not do, did not he know all things?</p>

He knows them ſo, as to bring them to judgment for all their works of iniquity.

God will ſay to them, I know you not ſo, as to have any communion with you; to eternity you ſhall never know me, nor I you; better it were to be ſtricken thorow with a thouſand Thunderbolts, than to hear God ſay, <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi> So God retaliates wicked men

               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:62988:157"/>
               <p>To be abſolutely and ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, requireth theſe Properties.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There muſt be no beginning: For all beginnings argue a change from a not being to a being; as when a creature is created, there is a change from a not being to a being: So in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that which was not a child, becomes a child; ſo in alteration: Now the Lord hath no beginning of his being, he is from everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There muſt be no diſſolution, corruption, or alteration: Creatures are therefore changeable, becauſe the moſt noble of all are liable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation. God can turn Angels into nothing, the ſons of men into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; heaven and earth ſhall wax old like a garment: but now there can be no diſſolution, corruption, or anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation in God; <hi>Thou art God to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There muſt be no addition, nor diminution, nor increaſe, nor decreaſe; as we ſee in all creatures, they may be more perfect then they are; they that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:62988:158"/> are glorified, may and do increaſe in knowledge. Creatures may become alſo leſs then they are, as among the Angels, ſome of glorious Angels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ugly Devils; of happy Angels, miſerable Devils; of pure Angels, unclean Spirits. So men may decreaſe and increaſe in knowledge and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in all excellencies inward and outward: Righteous man is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſinful; he that knew much, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ignorant. So all Creatures are liable to alteration, either to become better or worſe. But God is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that he cannot be better or worſe than he is; ſo good, that he cannot be better; ſo wiſe, that he cannot be more wiſe; ſo holy, that he cannot be more holy; he cannot increaſe in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though the Lord deriveth and communicateth his bounty and goodneſs to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet there is no diminution of it: we ſee many thouſand Stars derive their light from the Sun, yet the light of the Sun is no way diminiſhed.</p>

               <p>MOreover, God is Immutable or unchangeable all theſe ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is unchangeable in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He is the ſame Being from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting to everlaſting: <hi>I am that I am,</hi> I am the ſame Being now what I am; <hi>Before Abraham was I am,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 58. So God may ſay, Before <hi>Adam</hi> was, I am; before the foundations of the world, were I am: and when the foundations of the world ſhall be no more, God is the ſame Being.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is unchangeable in all his glorious Perfections, and Properties or Attributes: his Almighty Power is unchangeable; his infinite Wiſdome is unchangeable; his Goodneſs, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Juſtice, All-ſufficiency are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable; therefore <hi>his Love</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>an everlaſting love; his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever, his goodneſs endureth continually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God is unchangeable in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees:
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:62988:159"/> Whatſoever God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, ſhall come to paſ according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all things ſhall be, and fall out. His Decree of Election is unalterable, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. The foundation of the Lord ſtandeth ſure;</hi> that is, his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtandeth ſure, compared to a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the immutable firmneſs of it. <hi>Pilate</hi> could ſay, <hi>What I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I have written;</hi> he would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the inſcription on the Croſs upon the <hi>Jews</hi> intreaty: God much more can ſay, What I have written in my Book of Life, ſhall be written; what I have blotted out of my Book, I will have never to be altered. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are called his Counſels; <hi>The counſels of the Lord ſtand for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</hi> Pſal. 33. 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God is unchangeable in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings: What good things he hath promiſed to give to his choſen, all ſhall be made good; what evil he hath threatned to bring upon the impenitently wicked, all ſhall
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:62988:159"/> come to paſs. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, <hi>God is not a man, that he ſhould lie; neither the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent, Numb.</hi> 23. 19. God is not a man, that he ſhould lie, that is, promiſe and not perform, falſifie, or go back from his word; threaten, and not put his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in execution.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God is immutable in all his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: in his Love, in his Hatred; <hi>Whom he loveth, he loveth to the end;</hi> he loveth his Elect from everlaſting to everlaſting: Whom he hateth, he hateth to the end; the Damned are the immortal objects of his eternal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God is immutable in all his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gifts. <hi>Rom. 11. 29. The gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> When God pardoneth, juſtifieth, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, calleth, reconcileth any ſoul to himſelf, he never repenteth of ſo doing to any man, but what he doth ſhall ſtand inviolate.</p>

Thus all Creatures receiving their being from God, are at God's diſpoſing: if
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:62988:160"/> he ſpeak the word, Let a Creature be made thus and thus, it is ſo; if he ſay, Let that Creature be turned into deſtruction, it is deſtroyed: If God withdraw the influence of his favour and ſupportance from the Creatures, they cannot ſubſiſt for a moment, but ſuffer a pitiful change; but now, God depending upon no ſuperiour cauſe, not liable to the will, pleaſure, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a ſupreme power, abideth the ſame for ever, without the leaſt ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of change.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is Immutable, becauſe he<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 2.</note> is moſt ſimple, void of all compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: he is <hi>purus actus,</hi> a pure act; there is no paſſive power in him. All Creatures are therefore mutable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſome compoſition in them. Man is obnoxious to diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe compounded of a body and ſoul; his body liable to alteration and corruption, becauſe 'tis compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the elements.

But now in God there is no mixture, no compoſition; but whatſoever is in God, is God, is his Eſſence, therefore no alteration, or mutation can be in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe God comprehendeth in<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 3.</note> him all fulneſs of perfection; he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect, therefore he is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

               </q>
               <p>A Creature may alter from good to bad, from bad to worſe; ſo from bad to good, from good to better: There is no creature but is capable of more perfections then they have: An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though they have great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

               <p n="1">1. In his Decrees, becauſe God is omniſcient; ſo he foreſees all incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, to prevent errour or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; he cannot err, becauſe he infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly foreknows all.

               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:62988:162"/>
               <p>Repentance is ſpoken of God for our<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> underſtandings ſake; when the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, That God did repent of this or that thing, it ſpeaks of God af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men for our learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is ſaid to repent; not as if there were a change of mind in God, as when men repent; but when there is a change wrought in the creature, their change is his repentance. The deſtruction of the old World, is Gods repenting of making man upon the earth. The removing of plagues and curſes (the evils which he inflicts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us) is Gods repentance of the evils he inflicteth: So the preventing of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils threatned, his bidding the Angel to put up his Sword drawn forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is Gods repentance of the evil: So then there is a double change, <hi>ſubjectiva,</hi> or <hi>in agente<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectiva,</hi> or <hi>in patiente:</hi> The change is altogether in the creature, the object and patient, not in God the agent.</p>
               <p>If God be Immutable, how then is<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:62988:163"/> it ſaid, That God is ſometime angry with his people? and that ſometimes he is ſaid to rejoyce over them. Now he ſmiles upon them, and kiſſeth his Spouſe; anon he withdraws himſelf, and frowns upon her; this argues a change of affections.</p>
               <p>We muſt diſtinguiſh between Gods<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> love to us, and joy over us; and our apprehenſion of his love and joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his affection, and the ſenſe of his affection to us. Gods love is immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, there's no decay in it; but there may be a decay and want of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The change is in us, not in God; our looſe walking, or our falling into ſome ſin, is the cauſe of our want of the apprehenſion of his favour: Shall we ſay that the fire heateth not, or that the Sun ſhines not, when we ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a Wall in the ſhade? We ſay that God changeth, when as we remove further from God, and ſet up a ſin, like a partition Wall, between our ſouls, and the light of his countenance: So
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:62988:163"/> that as the Lord in another ſenſe ſpake to <hi>Iſrael, O Iſrael, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9. <hi>But in me is thy help:</hi> May be ſpoken to all Chriſtians, that have not their former quickning and raviſhing apprehenſions of Gods favour in Chriſt; Oh thou mourning and diſconſolate ſoul! thy ſorrow, thy ſpiritual darkneſs is from thy ſelf; in me is thy comfort, and in my favour is light, without ſhadow of change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet we are apt to conceive a mutation in God.

                  </gap> God did promiſe or threaten abſolutely without any condition, if he fulfilled not, he were mutable, and ſhould deny himſelf; but ſeeing he promiſeth upon condition, if not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on our part, there is no change in God, he remains faithful to his Word: Do thou what he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, God will make good what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be a temporal Promiſe, we muſt conſider whether it be good for us: God doth conſider it; and if it be not good for thee, he gives thee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort inſtead of that; yet he is immutable, becauſe temporal promiſes have this condition implied, If they be good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. So again for Threatnings; they were with a condition of Repentance:
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:62988:164"/> If men repent not, he will ſhoot out the Arrows of his indignation; but if the wicked ſhall humble themſelves, and turn from their wicked wayes, they ſhall live. <hi>Nineveh</hi> had been deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not <hi>Nineveh</hi> repented. <hi>Iſrael</hi> had been conſumed, had not <hi>Moſes</hi> made interceſſion: So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf before the Lord, and prayed; ſo that ſtill the change is in us, not in God; he abideth faithful in his promiſes and threatnings: Repent, and God will repent of the evil; but he that walketh contrary to God, God will walk contrary to him.</p>
               <p>Gods Promiſes are mutable, ſo are<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. 4.</note> his Threatnings, becauſe they depend upon a mutable condition in men; as men are, ſo God makes good both.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Hath God inflicted wrath upon wicked men in foregoing Ages? Hath God damned unclean Sodomites, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Whoremongers and Adulterers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:62988:166"/> Drunkards in the very act, as <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> and turned the Covetous into Hell? Then be admoniſhed and tremble, leſt the like condemnation betide thee for the like ſins; for God is immutably holy, and hates ſin in thee as in them immutably; he is juſt, and will inflict the like vengeance upon preſent impenitent ſinners, as upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: as our Saviour ſaid to the <hi>Jews, Think ye, that the Galileans, whoſe blood Pilate mingled with the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. It ſhould admoniſh and inſtruct the wicked of the neceſſity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; either you muſt change, or God muſt change, but God changeth not; therefore either the profane

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſheweth the miſery of the Damned: God hates them, and his hatred is immutable; they are the ever living objects of his wrath, and of his hatred: If there were any probability or poſſibility of the alteration of their woful condition, the Damned might have ſome hope to be happy, and to get out of that fire: but the Damned being utterly rejected of God, become immutably impenitent; being immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably ſinful, they are immutably miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>

               <p>A thing is ſaid to be perfect two ways.</p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:62988:186"/>
               <p n="1">1. When of imperfect, it is made perfect: thus the whole world of a rude and imperfect Chaos, was made ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably perfect, ſo God cannot be ſaid to be perfect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A thing is ſaid to be perfect, when there is nothing wanting to the complement and perfection of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: thus a man is perfect, when there is nothing wanting, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement and perfection of his nature; thus God is perfect, who hath all, and wanteth nothing, This is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it.</p>
               <p>Gods Perfection is that glorious<note place="margin">God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection deſcribed.</note> and Divine Property, by which he hath an infinite fulneſſe of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, without any defect or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection. A thing is ſaid to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>privativè,</hi> when it wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which pertains to the nature of it, ſo are all things perfect in their kind, yet there is a <hi>negative imperfection,</hi> for each creature may be better; Angels have this nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive imperfection, now in God as
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:62988:186"/> there is no imperfection, ſo he is fully and abſoutely perfect. Or briefly: Gods perfection is his infinite fullneſs of all excellencies pertaining to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his divine nature, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing, neither can any thing be added to him.</p>
               <p>In God there is an all-fullneſſe of all kinds, degrees, and extents of being and excellencies: this is implyed in that name by which he chargeth <hi>Moſes</hi> to reveal him to the children of <hi>Iſrael, I am hath ſent me to you, I am is my name, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. I am all things, I am wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I am power, I am mercy, I am goodneſs, I am grace and glory: I am riches, honours, beauty, bleſſedneſs, &amp;c. Hence the Scripture calleth God by the name of every thing, a ſun, a ſhield, a rock, a tower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all execellencies are in God, all wiſdome, all power, all goodneſſe, grace, glory, majeſty, beauty, riches, honours, holineſſe, whatſoever is a perfection or excellency, is in God.</p>

                  </gap>on, Sanctification, Glorification are perfect.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew how God is perfect, I may the better do it in theſe following concluſions</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath not his perfection from another, but from himſelf; for before any thing was, he was abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:62988:187"/> therefore from himſelf, he is <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum,</hi> the firſt good, therefore the firſt perfection; but all creatures have their perfection in him as the Fountain, as the Sun hath light from it ſelf, and the Stars from him; as the Sea hath water from it ſelf, and all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers their water from the Sea: What haſt thou, O man, which thou haſt not received from God? whatſoever excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency any one hath, it came from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods perfection is a boundleſs and unlimited perfection; for having it from himſelf, he hath none to ſet bounds or limits to him, but his own ſelf, who is infinite and unlimited. The perfection of the moſt excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is limited, that meaſure of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it hath which God vouchſafeth to it; the Angels themſelves have no other, and can have no greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than God beſtoweth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Divine perfection is but one ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and entire form or being, though God be perfectly holy, wiſe, juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all is but one and the ſame ſimple
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:62988:188"/> being. Theſe perfections are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe habits and qualities in God; the perfections of creatures are various and diſtinct habits and qualities, as wiſdom, goodneſs, holineſs, power, which are all diſtinct in them. <hi>Zanchy</hi> fitly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it; the Sea is but one and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire body of water, thus God is a Sea of perfection; but Rivers are ſo many diſtinct things, though they come from the Sea, and run into the Sea, and do partake of the nature of the Soil through which they run, thus are the perfections that are in the creatures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God is ſo perfect, that he cannot be more perfect, nor leſs, becauſe all his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ection is from himſelf, but the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be more perfect; Angels may increaſe in power, wiſdom, knowledge, and creatures may become leſs perfect, as the Angels, that of bleſſed, holy Angels, became curſed, unholy; and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Devils.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God is purely perfect, there is not the leaſt mixture of imperfection in God, either privative, or negative;
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:62988:188"/> Creatures have ſome mixtures, Angels have a negative imperfection.</p>
               <p n="6">6. God is immutably perfect, there is no poſſibility for God to loſe any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his perfection: Creatures, (though perfect) are in a poſſibility of loſing their perfection, as Angels did, and as <hi>Adam</hi> did; the elect Angels are now preſerved in their ſtate of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the power of God.</p>
               <p n="7">7. God is indeficiently perfect: God continually communicateth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable perfections to his creatures, which are innumerable, yet is there not the leaſt dimution of his own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all excellencies are derived from him, as light from the Sun.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:62988:189"/> in him is no darkneſs at all;</hi> he is moſt pure and perfect light; he is eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light, and perfectly light, eſſentially and perfectly holy; and St. <hi>John</hi> is not contented to have ſaid, <hi>He is light,</hi> but addeth, <hi>In him there is no darkneſ</hi> there is not the leaſt want, defect or imperfection in God, not ſo much as the leaſt ſhadow of imperfection in him. God ſaith, <hi>Gen. 17. 1. I am God all-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> and Gods ſufficiency is nothing elſe but his perfection: I am God, who have perfect power and wiſdom. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſons of the point are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is no want of any<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 1.</note> good in him, therefore he is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; want is an imperfection; there is no want of riches, of honour, of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of power in God. There is <hi>nulla perfectionis privatio,</hi> no priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfection; <hi>Nulla negatio,</hi> no Negation of Perfection in God, as Divines ſpeak; whatſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is in God, is moſt fully in him. <hi>Dyoniſius</hi> ſaith, God is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo perfect, that nothing can be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:62988:189"/> ſo perfectly great, glorious, good, wiſe; but God is infinitely moſt great, good, wiſe, glorious, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe all perfections in creatures<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 2.</note> are from God, therefore he is moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; every good and perfect gift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from the Father of lights, therefore he hath every good gift in him. What haſt thou, but what thou haſt received from God, wiſdom from God, ſtrength from God, &amp;c. therefore he that giveth to all wiſdom, hath all wiſdom in himſelf without any want.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe as he giveth perfection to<note place="margin" type="runSum">Reaſ. 3.</note> all creatures, ſo he giveth without ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any of his perfection; though he gives much, yet he hath not the leſſe, but is as perfect, as if no creature had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perfection from him. This argues that a man hath a vaſt eſtate, when he hath ſufficient for himſelf, and to give to others; but this argues that God is exceeding, and rich after another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than men are; for let the richeſt m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſſe; but when God giveth, he hath
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:62988:190"/> nothing the leſſe: Though Heaven and earth, and every creature be full of his perfections, communicated from him to them, yet God hath not the leſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly he is moſt perfect. All creatures are ſo many thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand veſſels of his perfections, yet God is ſtill a boundleſſe and bottomleſſe Sea of perfection, ſo then God is,</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Objections againſt God's Perfections an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</head>
               <p>BUt here it may be objected, How<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. 1.</note> can God be ſaid to be moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of himſelf, when he made all things for himſelf? <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
               <p>Things are made for a threefold end<note place="margin">Sol.</note> to him that makes them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be auxiliary or helpful to him: Thus the Artificer makes Tools for helps to him in his calling. Thus Kings gather Forces for helps to them. Thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gathered Manna to help them in their penury. In this ſenſe God made nothing for himſelf, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the help of any creature; though God be the Lord of Hoſts, yet he needs not the powers of his creatures, of all the Troops in Heaven and earth to help him, God is perfectly all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To augment and increaſe the power, greatneſs and happineſs of man. Men get more Riches, to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more great, and outwardly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:62988:191"/> Kings multiply Men and Horſes, to make themſelves more Potent, and to enlarge their Dominions, to make themſelves greater Monarchs; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the more they have, the more perfect they waxe; but now God did not make all things, or any thing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his greatneſſe, or power, or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. The reaſon is becauſe God was perfectly happy, great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, before there was a creature made, and is ſo, if no creatures were, <hi>from everlaſting to everlaſting thou art God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God made all things for himſelf, meerly that he might lay open himſelf, and communicate his goodneſſe and perfection to the creatures. God that is perfectly good, made all, that he might beſtow his goodneſſe upon all, his wiſdom to ſome, his power to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, this noteth the perfection of <hi>Gods</hi> goodneſs: <hi>Bonum eſt ſui diffuſivum;</hi> it is the nature of good, to be diffuſive of goodneſſe. The Stars were not made for the Sun, as if the Sun had need of their light; but they are made, that
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:62988:191"/> the Sun might communicate light unto them, and make them ſhine; ſo the creatures were not made for God, as If he had need of them; but he hath made them, to communicate his goodneſs to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God made them for the manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his own glory by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: We come to acknowledge the divine perfections which are in God, by beholding the ſcattered perfections in creatures; for we muſt flie to imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect things, to admire the perfection of God. Suppoſe we had never ſeen the Sun, but onely the bright Stars, and knew that there is a Sun, from whom they borrowed all their light, how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhould we conceive the Sun to be? Thus it is with God; we ſee the twinkling perfections in the creatures, but not the glorious perfection of God; but now we know, that all theſe come from God: how perfect is that God that made creatures ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? And this is to glorifie God.</p>
               <p>If Creatures do not glorifie God,<note place="margin" type="runSum">

                  </note>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:62988:192"/> then God is not perfect, for glory per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to perfection: therefore when creatures give glory to him, they add ſome perfection to him; when they do not glorifie him, he wanteth ſome perfection.</p>
               <p>God's glory is to be conſidered two<note place="margin">Sol.</note> ways, as the School-men obſerve;</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ad extra;</hi> as it implies the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures acknowledging of theſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in God: If the creatures do, or do not glorifie him, by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:62988:192"/> teſtifie what is in God: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; a man that is wiſe, witty, or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we praiſe him, we add not to his learning; if we do not praiſe him, we diminiſh not his learning; our praiſe is but a teſtification of it; praiſe him, or not praiſe him, he remaineth wiſe and learned: So it is with God; whether we glorifie, or not glorifie him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth perfect. The Sun were a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious creature in it ſelf, were there no eye to behold it it, no tongue to ſpeak of it.</p>
               <p>If God be perfect, ſo as that he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin" type="runSum">Object. 3.</note> nothing, why then doth he require our worſhip and ſervice?</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Not that he needeth our<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> ſervice: Other Lords need the ſervice of their ſervants; the greateſt Princes in the world, need the ſervice of their Subjects; but God doth not; he is perfectly happy, if we did not ſerve him. <hi>If thou ſinneſt, what doeſt thou againſt him? or if thy tranſgreſſions be multiplied, what doeſt thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what giveſt thou

               <p>HEnce ſee, that it is of meer grace<note place="margin">Infer. 1.</note> that any are ſaved. What if all the ſons of men had been for ever caſt into the pit of perdition, it had been nothing to God; as when the old world was drowned, what was it to God? his perfection was not diminiſhed, when they all periſhed. Diſpute not why ſo few are ſaved; wonder rather that any are ſaved, ſeeing God was infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect in himſelf, when no man or creature had any being, and will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, if all had been loſt: He needeth neither men nor Angels to praiſe him; therefore every one that is ſaved may ſay, Lord, we are ſaved, not becauſe thou didſt need us, or our ſervices, or praiſes, but becauſe thou art gracious to whom thou wilt be gracious.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſhould wean us, and all our<note place="margin">Infer. 2.</note> thoughts and affections, from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

               <p>THis informs us, why God throws<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 1.</note> away, and loatheth the duties, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and performances of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they are done with rotten, unſound, and wicked hearts. He being a Spirit, a perfect God, looks at thoſe that ſerve him with perfect hearts, and where the heart is found or imperfect. He regards no more the wicked man's praying, than he doth the bleſſing of an Idol; yea, he hates his moſt glorious duties, as wilful mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Malac.</hi> 1. 8. It was a great ſin in the time of the Law, to offer up the lame, and the blind of the flock to God, who
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:62988:194"/> required the beſt of the herd, and of the flock for ſacrifice: It is no leſs an evil, to offer up lame or blind prayers, or any act of lame or blind obedience. What makes your duties ſo lame, ſo blind, but your rotten and imperfect hearts? Your imperfect hearts, make your duties and perſous abominable. It is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> that <hi>he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, but not with a perfect heart,</hi> 2 Chron. 25. 2. the good duties of the wicked, are ſins to them; both they and their ſervices are rejected: This will cut the unſound heart to the quick, when he ſhall hear Chriſt ſay to him; It is true, theſe and theſe good works thou haſt done, theſe duties and ſuch like thou haſt performed; but yet he will ſay to them, as ſometime he did to the Angel of the Church in <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, I have not found thy works perfect before God,</hi> Rev. 3. 2. therefore all thy works are but loſt labour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If God be a moſt perfect God, this<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 2.</note> infinite perfection of God ſhould make
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:62988:195"/> us the more to humble our ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, to be low and baſe in our own eyes, and that in diverſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of our great imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: God is light, we are darkneſſe; God is Almighty, we Impotent; God is Eternal, we Mortal; God is Good, we Evil; God is Holy, we Impure; God only Wiſe, we Fooliſh; we are very Beaſts before him; God hath all perfections, we all imperfections in us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the very graces in us, the conſideration of Gods infinite perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſhould make us be baſe and low in our own eyes, though we were full of the graces of Gods Spirit, becauſe our very perfections have much imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them; our faith is mingled with much unbelief, our repentance with impenitency, our patience with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and our obedience with much diſobedience: If the moſt perfect God ſhould obſerve the imperfections of our perfections, the defects of our graces,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:62988:195"/> the ungodlineſſe of our very godlineſs, (as I may ſo ſpeak) who then could ſtand before him? yea, had we our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated perfection, and were as perfect as <hi>Adam</hi> in innocence, yet ſtill we ſhould be baſe in our own eyes, looking to Gods infinite perfections. The glorious Angels, who are the moſt perfect crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet cover their faces ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as being unworthy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the infinite perfections of ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Be humbled in reſpect of all your Services and duties, that ye do to God, and for God, and that in three reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that all we do, is but little in compariſon of what God requireth at our hands: We do not bring in that full Tale of bricks, of prayers, of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of works which God requireth at our hands, and which we are bound to perform to our God. He that doth moſt, is very deficient; therefore we ſhould be humbled, conſidering what perfection God requireth at our hands.</p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:62988:196"/>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of the manifold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that adhere to all our ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and duties: As we ſaid but now of graces, ſo of duties, if God ſhould mark the imperfections of them, woe unto us, woe unto us for our praying and hearing, &amp;c. woe unto us for our duties and ſervices; conſidering what perfection of duties the perfect God requireth, how God commandeth us to pray, to hear his Word, to meditate upon it, to examine our ſelves, than he that prayes and heareth, and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth moſt and beſt, may be in his own eyes, as if he had not prayed, nor heard, nor done any thing at all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this reſpect, that he doth all that he can do, yet is he an unprofitable ſervant, becauſe God being moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is no whit the better, and more perfect by all our duties, by all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience all our goodneſſe, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and performances extend not to him; therefore never pride your ſelves in your duties, but go on in a courſe of obedience, and be humbled ſtill.</p>

                  <p>SEeing God is perfect, then be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe 5.</note> to imitate God in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to ſerve God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, which is the thing he ſo much requireth; the ſervice that is onely well-pleaſing, crowned with perfect reward; and without this kind of perfection, all glorious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are no other, in God's account, than the curſed works of darkneſs. The Exhortation is to a double Duty.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To be perfect as God is perfect:</hi> We may be, we muſt be perfect as God is perfect. We cannot be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect as God; we muſt ſtrive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a perfection of reſemblance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we cannot poſſibly attain to a perfection of equality, created nature being uncapable thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="385" facs="tcp:62988:200"/>
                  <p>Now here I will ſhew how we may be perfect, as God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and then ſhew, what it is to ſerve God with a perfect heart. Now firſt, That we may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as God is perfect;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us lahour to get all grace to exiſt in us;</hi> As God's perfection is the fulneſs of all excellencies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the nature of God; ſo is a Chriſtians perfection, an having of all grace requiſite to a childe of God; as perfection of parts is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſire to make a man perfect. Were there a defect but of one excellency in God, he were imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: were there but one member in a body defective, it were an imperfect body; ſo the want of one grace makes an imperfect Saint: therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth <hi>to add to faith, vertue; and to vertue, knowledge; and to knowledge, temperance; and to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, patience; and to patience, godlineſ and to godlineſs, brotherly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſ
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:62988:201"/> and to brotherly kindneſs, charity,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 5, 6. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth us <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> wherein there is no exceſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 18. It is impoſſible for a man to be too holy, too gracious. Covetous men add ground to ground, houſe to houſe, field to field, when they reſolve to be rich; thus Saints ſhould add one vertue to another, if they will be perfect as God is perfect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt grow in theſe acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red graces;</hi> the more we grow in them, the more we come near God in perfection; the more holy we grow, the nearer we come to him that is perfectly holy; as a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing childe comes near the ſtature and perfection of a man. He is not in any wiſe perfect, that grows not more perfect: A dead childe grows not, painted trees grow not, and ſo will never come to perfection: Thy holineſs is but a dead holineſs, thy faith but a dead
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:62988:201"/> or painted faith, if it grow not: Gods perfections are eminent in him; we muſt ſtrive to be eminent as he is; this was St. <hi>Paul's</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. The perfection of Saints in this life is to be ſenſible of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and to deſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Take it my brethren, for a ſure rule, that the work of grace was never begun in that heart, where God doth not by dgrees perfect the work; for he is perfect in all his works; perfect in the work of Sanctification of his elect, as in the Creation of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>We ſhould extend the work of grace in us as far as poſſibly we can. Let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing,</hi> Jam. 1. 4. Let pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience have its perfect work in all afflictions, and to all men. There are two Graces, wherein we ſhould reſemble God in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The one is <hi>in love to our
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:62988:202"/> enemies;</hi> the ſun of our love muſt ſhine upon them; ſo doth God's perfect love, <hi>and in ſo doing ye ſhall be like your heavenly Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In mercifulneſ</hi> in the works of mercy to the diſtreſſed, yea even to enemies themſelves; <hi>Luk. 6. 38. And in ſo doing ye ſhall be like your heavenly Father:</hi> So that from thoſe places we may ſee what it is to be petfect as God is perfect. A merciful man, whoſe mercy runs round the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is perfect as God is perfect; a loving man, that can pray for, bleſs, pardon, even his enemies, is perfect as God is perfect.</p>

                  <p>NOw I come briefly to the next branch of the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Is God perfect? then ſerve him with a perfect heart. God ſpeaks to us, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Solomon; And now Solomon my Son, ſerve God with a perfect heart, and with a
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:62988:202"/> willing mind,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 6. Thus God ſpeaks to every one of us, <hi>Thou my ſon, the ſon of my grace, the ſon of my love, of my mercy, ſerve thou me with a perfect heart.</hi> Now what it is to ſerve God with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, theſe three things will ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To ſerve God with thy whole heart, with all thy mind, will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;</hi> The whole ſoul muſt be taken up with God in his ſervice; lift up thy heart to God as well as thine eyes; bow thy heart as well as thy knees; do all thy duties with thy whole heart; a divided, a diſtracted heart, is an imperfect heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To ſet up pure aims and ends in thy heart in all ſervices done to God:</hi> A ſincere heart, is a perfect heart; to ſerve God with ſuch an heart, is to ſerve him with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart: Then do we ſerve God ſincerely, when we ſeek to advance God in all that we do; we ſeek that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:62988:203"/> God may be glorified, and ſo in all acts of obedience. <hi>Jehu</hi>'s heart was not perfect, becauſe he did not ſeek God in doing the will of God: A man may ſerve himſelf in doing God's will.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To have in thy heart a full reſpect to all Gods commandments;</hi> when it is in thy heart to do all God's Commandments with all thy heart; to be wanting in no duty, in no act of obedience, this is to be perfect; Such a man as this, is a man after God's own heart. Some give this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to be a a man after God's own heart, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he was ſo zealous for God: Others, becauſe he was ſo full of praiſes. But this is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſts reaſon, <hi>Acts 13. 22. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> is called a man God's after own heart, becauſe, he fulfilled all Gods will, to do all which God commandeth. We ſay the eye is perfectly drawn in a picture, when
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:62988:203"/> it equally looks upon all in the ſame room; So that is a perfect heart which equally looks to all Commandments of God. Now to ſtir you up to ſerve God with a perfect heart, conſider theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Where perfection of heart is, there the weakect per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances are accepted; the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows<note place="margin">Luk. 21. 2, 3.</note> two mites were better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, then the great largeſſes of the rich; the infirmities of the Saints, in their faithful ſervices, becauſe done with a perfect heart. <hi>Job</hi> had bitter temptations, and murmrings, and many impatient fits, yet all were forgotten; for what ſaith the holy Ghoſt? <hi>have ye not heard of the patience of Job?</hi> Jam. 5. 11.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God will ſurely protect ſuch; they are his jewels; the Lord highly prizeth them, and would have all the world take notice of ſuch men: God even boaſteth of
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:62988:204"/> ſuch men. <hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. the Lord ſaith of <hi>Joh,</hi> that he was a man that was perfect and upright; he ſpeaks it in the commendation of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 6. Is God perfect? the very conſideration of God's perfection, may teach us what a woful creature a wicked man is: Hell is not more contrary to Heaven, and the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs to the brighteſt ſhine, then a wicked man is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to God: The Lord is perfectly full of all divine excellencies and perfections: A wicked man is full of all hideous deformities and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections: God is perfectly pure; the wicked are perfectly impure; God perfectly holy and righteous; the wicked perfectly unholy, and full of all unrighteouſneſs. You that call God Father (as there is no wicked man but calleth God Father) if he be your Father, where is your perfection of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of reſemblance to him?
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:62988:204"/> What? to be a ſwiniſh drunkard, is this to be perfect as God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect? What? to be unclean and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, is this Gods perfection? the moſt pure and perfect God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims you all, and looketh upon you as Baſtards, and not as Sons, and gives you up to your Father the Devil; You are perfect as the Devil your Father is perfect, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly wicked, perfectly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, perfectly hating holineſs, hating it with a perfect hatred: And God will make the impenitent to be like the devil, perfectly curſed, and perfectly miſerable as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is.</p>

               <p>There is a paſſive power, which receiveth or ſuffereth from an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but acteth not: this is not in God, who is <hi>purus actus,</hi> a pure act: God is not obnoxious to any alteration or mutation; there is nothing but an active power in God. So then God is ſaid to be <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, powerful,</hi> becauſe he can do, and will do whatſoever he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: and <hi>Omnipotens, Almighty,</hi> becauſe he can do whatſoever is poſſible to be done. This Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency is twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, their is <hi>Abſoluta Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia;</hi> God's abſolute Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: He is abſolutely and perfectly
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:62988:209"/> Almighty; he can do whatſoever his infinite underſtanding concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth may be done; he can make thouſands of worlds if he pleaſe, he can make infinite moe creatures then there are. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20. God can do more abundantly then we can ask or think: It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the underſtandings of men and Angels to conceive what God can do; he is able to do more abundantly then the vaſt thoughts and conceits of Angels can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend: And of this Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy the Scripture ſpeaketh, when it calleth God <hi>the Almighty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is <hi>Potentia Dei actualis,</hi> or <hi>ordinaria,</hi> as the Schools term it; the actual or ordinary power of God; but more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called his actual Omnipotency, which is this: not onely that God can do more then he will; but that God effectually, perfectly and really doth whatſoever he willeth to be done. And it is <hi>Zanchi</hi>'s ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:62988:210"/> 
                  <hi>That when ſoever the Prophets joyn Gods power to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, it always denoteth Gods actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Omnipotency; becauſe God will really and truly make good his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</hi> So that this now is the ſhort deſcription of God's Omnipotency; It is the moſt glorious perfection<note place="margin">Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</note> of God, whereby he doth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he will, and can do whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is poſſible to be done.</p>

               <p>BUt we ſhall the better behold the nature of Omnipotency in theſe following things. There are theſe things required in Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to be Almighty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he can effect whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is poſſible to be done: So that <hi>Omne poſſibile eſt objectum Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae; every thing poſſible is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Omnipotency.</hi> Mark 10. 27. <hi>All things are poſſible with God.</hi> So <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 37. There is nothing that the

Behold I am the Lord, the God of all fleſh: Is there any thing too hard for me?</hi> Tell me, what thing is there that I cannot do? I know not any thing that is hard to do but I can do it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he can do all things <hi>facillime,</hi> very eaſily. God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can do all things moſt eaſily; what more eaſie then to command a thing to be done? if he ſpeak the word it is done inſtantly: If he doth but ſay, Let there be light, let a world be created, let Heaven and Earth, let Sun Moon and Stars be made, and they are made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly according to his word. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a great work the whole world is, with all the creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; the Almighty God did but give forth a word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and they were all made. <hi>By the word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the hoſts of
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:62988:211"/> them, by the breath of his month: he ſpake, and it was done, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and it ſtood faſt,</hi> Pſa. 33. 6, 9. ſo God can command mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, comforts, and all are done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, what more eaſie way of doing? this ſheweth that God is Omnipotent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he can do all things <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtibiliter,</hi> without reſiſtance, let, hinderance, oppoſition, and difficulty: this the Lord Almighty doth: there is no power can make reſiſtance, there is no power can hinder him; he can remove Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, daſh Rocks to peices, puff and blow away all creatures; Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency infinitely ſurpaſſeth all power, all is ſubject to this omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency; Angels in Heaven, Devils in Hell, Men on Earth, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>he ſaith to the deep be dry,</hi> Iſ. 44. 27. he commandeth the earth and it openeth her mouth, <hi>Num.</hi> 16. 30, 31.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To be Almighty, is to do whatſoever he pleaſeth, and to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:62988:211"/> be able to do more then he will: this onely God can do whatſoever he pleaſeth, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 115. 3. yea, God can do more then he will do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 9.

               <p>THat God is Omnipotent, may appear by divers Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> 1. It is evident from the Creation of the World; to create the leaſt creature is an act of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, incommunicable to any creature. Angels are mighty in power, yet cannot they create the leaſt contemptible worm; if to create, demonſtrates an Almighty power, then much more the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this vaſte world, with all creatures within it, ſheweth God to be Omnipotent; lift up your
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:62988:212"/> eyes to Heaven, caſt them upon the earth, behold all creatures in it, and all are the work of his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 8. 3. As <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> in his pride boaſted; (<hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>that I have built, for the houſe of my Kingdom, by the might of my power, and honour of my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty?</hi>) may much better be ſpoken by the Lord of the world; Is not this great Heaven above, this great Earth below, that which I have builded, which I have created by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſty? <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pede Herculem,</hi> you may gueſs at the giant like ſtature of <hi>Hercules,</hi> by the length of his foot: you may ſee what an Almighty God I am, by the world which I have made, which in compariſon of my Almighty power, is but as a drop of a Bucket to the vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As the creation, ſo the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and preſervation of the
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:62988:212"/> whole world, ſheweth his Almighty power; the ſame power is required to uphold, which is to make it: he made the world by the word of his power, ſo he upholds all things by the word of his power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. therefore the conſervation of the world is, <hi>Creatio continuata,</hi> a continued creation: and the word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Omnipotent, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth him that upholdeth, guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and governeth all things; if the ſame hand did not uphold this glorious fabrick, it would in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be turned into its firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. That the ſtrong and mighty creatures are all ſubject to him, ruled and ordered by him, are at his beck, and cannot but execute his will, argues his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power. The Angels are great in power; the good Angels flye from Heaven to do his will, if he commandeth. The principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers of Hell cannot
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:62988:213"/> ſtir an inch, but at his pleaſure; if he ſaith to the deep, <hi>be dry,</hi> the Seas are dry; if he ſaith to the Earth, <hi>open,</hi> it openeth its mouth; if he commandeth the Mountains to remove, they are gone; if he ſmites the Rocks, they become duſt; if millions of Men ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, he can deſtroy them in a moment: As the men of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhemeſh</hi> cried out, <hi>who is able to ſtand before the mighty God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> ſo the world of creatures may cry, tis not this world, nor a thouſand more can ſtand before this mighty God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. If all the power of all creatures in Heaven, Earth, and Hell could meet in one creature, yet all would be but as a drop in compariſon of Gods Almighty power, yet there is much power in the creatures, all is derived from him, even the great power of the Angels: Now he that hath given to thouſands of creatures great
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:62988:213"/> power, he is much more powerful who is the Almighty God; if An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be great in power, if beaſts be ſo powerful, if Rocks and Mountains be ſo ſtrong, what is God the giver of this power? if drops of power be ſo great, what is the Sea?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Gods power is infinite, therefore Omnipotent, <hi>natura ſua,</hi> in his nature; becauſe his Omnipotency is his very eſſence, infinite in reſpect of his nature, by which he doth whatſoever he doth; his action is never ſo great, but it can be greater, more intended, infinite in reſpect of the objects; there can be no end of his works; he can make infinite more creatures then he hath made; A Limner or Painter that can draw one Picture, can make more, he that can fanſie a Palace, and according to the <hi>idea</hi> of it in his mind can build it, can build more: God that hath made one World, can with as
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:62988:214"/> much eaſe create many more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. As Gods underſtanding, knowledge, or wiſdom is, ſo is his power; whatſoever Gods infinite underſtanding can conceive to be done, that can his power do: A Painter can outwardly draw what he inwardly imagineth: So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>God can do more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly for us then we can ask or think,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 20. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to conceive what God can do.</p>

               <p n="2">2. God cannot do ſuch things as ſhould imply any defect in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In Scripture, his cannot do ſuch and ſuch things, is taken for his will not; he will not do ſuch or ſuch a thing, as <hi>Gen. 19. 22.

               <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>Seeing God is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Why was he ſix days in making

                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Beſides other reaſons, let this ſuffice, it was his pleaſure to be ſix days in making the world; his will is reaſon enough of his actions.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>Why doth God uſe the miniſtry of Angels and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being Omnipotent? he needs not their help.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> Among other reaſons let this ſuffice; God doth not employ them, as if he needed them in his working, but becauſe he will have his creatures do his ſervice: that a ſervant doth his Maſters work, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues not weakneſs in his Maſter: the miniſtry of Angels and men argues no defect of power in God.</p>

And if his power and wrath be againſt you, then all the Angels, Devils and creatures in heaven and earth are againſt you; all the plagues, curſes and vengeance that God can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon you, that the earth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, that hell affords, are againſt you: Therefore if ye will walk contrary to God, prepare ye to meet the Almighty God in moſt horrible and almighty wrath.

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THe Author of this Epiſtle, doubtleſs was St. <hi>Paul:</hi> the chief ſubject of it is Chriſt; A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary drift and ſcope of it, is to deter ſuch as make profeſſion of the faith of Chriſt from backſliding and departing from Chriſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by this Chapter, and by the fourth and tenth Chapters. In his
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:62988:221"/> ſpeaking of Chriſt he ſets him forth two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his abſolute and perſonal excellency; in the beginning of the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his comparative excellency; being compared with Angels, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and Prieſts, and Levitical Sacrifices, he ſheweth how Chriſt infinitely tranſcends all theſe. He ſheweth how far he excelleth all the glorious Angels in the firſt Chapter, and that in divers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is the natural Son of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is the heir of all things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is the Creatour and Lord of Angels, him all the glorious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels worſhip and adore.</p>
               <p>Then he ſhews Chriſts tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency above all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; he inſtanceth in <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt and Prince of Prophets, here in this third Chapter, ſetting forth the excellency of <hi>Moſes</hi> in an high manner, that he might the better
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:62988:221"/> declare the tranſcendent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſt above him.</p>
               <p>The thing chiefly commended in <hi>Moſes,</hi> was his faithfulneſs in Gods Houſe (by houſe, underſtand not a material, but a ſpiritual houſe) his Church. Now Chriſt excelled <hi>Moſes</hi> in two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt was the Son of God; <hi>Moſes</hi> a Servant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt was builder and Maſter of the Houſe; <hi>Moſes</hi> was part of this houſe.</p>
               <p>Now in the following Verſes, the Apoſtle ſtrongly inferreth, that Chriſt is more excellent then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and <hi>Moſes.</hi> We ought to give more heed to the word ſpoken by him, then to the word ſpoken by Angels or by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and this he preſſeth from the danger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleif, after men have heard and received the Goſpel of Chriſt. Thoſe that did not beleive <hi>Moſes,</hi> were not ſuffered to enter into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but periſhed in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſ
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:62988:222"/> Now the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that as God dealt with their forefathers for their unbelief, ſo will he deal with all unbeleivers, they ſhall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his glorious reſt, but ſhall periſh eternally.</p>
               <p>My Text is a ſerious admonition to all, to beware of unbeleif, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſhuts men out of heavenly reſt, and throws them headlong into helliſh torments. <hi>Wherefore</hi>]<note place="margin">Calv. in loc.</note> for ſo <hi>Calvin</hi> thinketh, is to be referred to this twelfth verſe, all the foregoing words being a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentheſis; <hi>take heed, leſt there be in any of you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the words there are theſe three things conſiderable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A dangerous diſeaſe, to which thoſe that make profeſſion of Chriſt are ſubject, <hi>viz.</hi> Apoſtacy from Chriſt, who is here ſtiled a living God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The cauſe of that dangerous diſeaſe, is an evil heart of unbeleif,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:62988:222"/> it is an hebraiſm, put for an evil unbeleiving heart, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth deſcribe unbeleif by an elegant <hi>paranomaſia.</hi>

                  </gap>, unbeleif is Apoſtacy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The cure and remedy both of the root and diſeaſe; <hi>Take heed,</hi>

               <p n="1">1. That an unbeleiving heart, is<note place="margin" type="runSum">Obſerv.</note> the evil heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That an unbeleiving heart, is the cauſe of Apoſtacy from God.</p>

The Apoſtle ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the ſtate of unregenerate perſons, men addicted to their luſts, ſaith, <hi>They are alienated from the life of God;</hi> that is, have no acquaintance with the holy, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly and ſpiritual life, this life is here called the life of God; and <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. it is called the life of Chriſt; <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> this life is alſo called the life of the ſpirit, and beleivers are alſo ſaid to live in the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 25. But this life I am not to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Tis taken for that eſſential<note place="margin">Vel quà ipſe vivit in ſeſe.</note> life of God, or that life which God liveth himſelf, and in himſelf, and which is very God himſelf. In him
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:62988:223"/> was life, ſaith <hi>John</hi> of Chriſt, as God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 4. that is, <hi>eſſentia vivens ab aeterno in aeternum,</hi> that living eſſence who lives for ever and ever, giving life to all others; and this I am to ſpeak of: As the life of God is taken two ways, ſo again living God is taken two ways in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either it is oppoſed unto dead and falſe gods, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 9. Ye turned from idols,</hi> which cannot hear, ſpeak, or do any thing for you, <hi>to the living and true God;</hi> Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Living God,</hi> implies that God is a powerful, lively, and effectual God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 31. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, moſt powerful, able to deſtroy body and ſoul; or, who eternally liveth to take eternal vengeance on your immortal ſouls. This being premiſed, I will briefly ſhew, what the life of God is. Thus it is deſcribed.</p>
               <pb n="432" facs="tcp:62988:224"/>
               <p>It is Gods own divine being,<note place="margin">Deſcr.</note> who of himſelf doth all things, and is the Author of all life in his creatures.</p>
               <p>Or thus, It is the divine being, who of himſelf, underſtandeth, willeth, and loveth infinitely, and is the fountain of all life, being, and motion in all his creatures, both bodily and ſpiritual. Let me give it in parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the divine being, ſo it is<note place="margin">Anima, vivere, &amp; operationes vitae.</note> diſtinguiſhed from the life of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for in their life are three things; the ſoul, by which it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; the life it ſelf; and the actions of life, diſtinguiſhed in the creatures; but in God, the eſſence, life, and the actions of life, are one and the ſame; his life is nothing elſe but his very being, hence he is called that life, and life eternal, and the living God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Who of himſelf doth all things, or of himſelf underſtandeth, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and loveth all things, and in
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:62988:224"/> this he is diſtinguiſhed from the life of creatures, for they live in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; live, move, and have their being in God; but he moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently lives of himſelf, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth and willeth of himſelf, therefore called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> who hath being from himſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is the Author of all life in his Creatures, in him they live; if he withdraw himſelf, Creatures are turned into deſtruction: if he ſay, <hi>Return again ye ſons of men;</hi> they live, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 90. 3. of dry bones he makes living men, and of living men he makes dry bones. Tis ſaid, <hi>he breathed the ſpirit of life into</hi> Adam, and he takes away mans breath again. Some Divines make a fivefold life of men.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The life of nature, and this God is the Author of, he made man a living ſoul; <hi>In him was life, and that life was the light of men,</hi> Joh. 1. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The life of grace; and it is
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:62988:225"/> God alone that quickens men that are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, to live the life of godlineſs, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The life of comfort; Sorrow is called death, <hi>Pſa. 116. 8. Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, mine eyes from tears,</hi> &amp;c. What is the eternal death of the damned, but eternal ſorrow? ſorrow is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the vale of death; Now it is the Lord that ſpeaks peace, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates joy to diſconſolate ſpirits; <hi>Vita nihil aliud eſt, quam actio cum de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectatione,</hi> as ſome define it: and what is the life of Angels and Saints, but unſpeakable and endleſs joy in God?</p>

Reſurrection of dead men to life; God onely by his almighty power, can command the graves to yeild up their dead, and make each ſoul to poſſeſs its own body, after a long divorce made by death. God alone brings theſe two old friends together, which at firſt were loth to part, and then ſhall
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:62988:225"/> never part again, but ſhall then live with God for ever, or elſe dye a living death with Devils in Hell.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Properties of the life of God, with reaſons to prove him to be a living God.</head>
               <p>NOw I ſhall explicate Gods life further in the properties of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a moſt perfect and bleſſed life; becauſe there is nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to make his life moſt perfect, he living of himſelf, independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is an immutable life; there is no change nor alteration of his life; man is up and down,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:62988:226"/> ſometimes brought as low as death anon revived, and walks again in the land of the living; Gods life is always the moſt happy, glorious and delightſom life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is an immortal and eternal life, it hath no beginning, neither is it capable of dying; God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to be.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall prove that God is a living God by Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For Scripture, read <hi>Deut. 32. 40. I lift up my hand to heaven, and ſay I live for ever.</hi> This lifting up the hand was either a ſign of ſwearing, or a geſture uſed by ſuch as took an oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 22. as <hi>Abram</hi> ſaid to the King of <hi>Sodom, I have lifted up my hand to the Lord, the moſt high God, the poſſeſſor of heaven and earth.</hi> Sometimes it was a ſign to make the hearers more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive; <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will lift up my hand to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and ſet up my ſtandard to the people, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 49. 22. Both ways
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:62988:226"/> it may be taken here, though in the former properly; for there <hi>Moſes</hi> brings in God ſwearing, <hi>I ſay, I live for ever;</hi> God ſpeaks like a living God. <hi>I ſay,</hi> ſaith God, None but he can ſay ſo: Should creatures be ſo impudent as to ſay, <hi>I ſay I live,</hi> God will make them appear to be but dead dogs. God ſaith, <hi>I live for ever;</hi> admit crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may ſay <hi>we live;</hi> yet herein is the living God diſcerned, <hi>I live for ever:</hi> Before the world was, I lived, and when the world ſhall have an end, I live, <hi>Pſal. 42. 2. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calls him <hi>the living God.</hi> Now the Reaſons of it are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe whatſoever is a perfection in the creature, is moſt eminent in God. Of all natural perfection life is the principal, it is better then beauty, ſtrength, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nothing is more dear then life: <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life. A living Dog is better then a dead
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:62988:227"/> Lion,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 4. One living Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is better then an huge Army of dead Souldiers; a living beggar is better then a rich Nobleman. Now if life be ſuch a perfection, then ſurely God is living, and his life is moſt perfect, and moſt eminent: If God were a dead God, he ſhould want the greateſt perfection; then many living creatures would be better then God himſelf; he is no God, if he be not a living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. From the actions of God, we may evidently argue him to be a living God; he knows all things, he wills all things, he makes all things; he is a God that heareth our prayers, and granteth the very deſires of our hearts, giveth the very things we beg, which he could not do, were he not a living God. What makes him the onely true God? but becauſe he is a living God. The falſe gods, the Idolls, the vanities of the <hi>Gentiles, have eyes, and ſee not; ears, and hear not;
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:62988:227"/> hands, and work not. Baal</hi> could not hear his Prieſts crying aloud to him, <hi>O Baal hear us;</hi> therefore they are no gods: But God hath eyes to ſee all things, yea the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of mens hearts; ears to hear the deſires and groans of the poor and dictreſſed; therefore he only is the true and living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. All our life is from him, therefore he is a living God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt is called <hi>The author of life,</hi> Acts 3. <hi>With thee is the fountain of life,</hi> Pſal. 36. 9. Life natural, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, eternal is from God as the fountain; therefore he is called life, not onely becauſe he is life <hi>eſſentialitèr,</hi> eſſentially; but alſo <hi>effectivè,</hi> effectually. And by the Platoniſts he is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               <p>NOw becauſe the Immortality of God (though it be a diſtinct Attribute) falls under, and in with the life of God; I will annex a brief diſcourſe of the nature of it, and ſo make application of the life and immortallity of God together. <hi>God is a living God,</hi> and this life of God is not ſubject to death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>immortal.</hi> Now I ſhall give a brief deſcription of Gods Immortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is that perfection of God,</hi>

                  <hi>whereby his life cannot be ſeparated from him by death.</hi> God cannot ceaſe to live; God cannot dye, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. The Reaſons of it are theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe God is moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, void of all compoſition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul: or a principle of life, and life it ſelf being the ſame in
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:62988:228"/> God, his own eſſence is his life. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things which are compounded, are ſubject to diſſolution: Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compounded of ſoul and body is obnoxious to a ſeparation by death; where there is no union, there is no ſeparation; where there can be no ſeparation of parts there can be no death or morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>But are not Angels and the ſouls of men immortal, who are not ſubject to death? therefore not God onely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. It is true, Angels and the ſouls of men are immortal, but they are ſubject to annihilation, which God is not: Angels and ſouls of men may ceaſe to be, but God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Angels and the Souls of men are immortal dependently; God conſerveth them in their being, they are kept by the power of God; but God is immortal abſolutely and independently.</p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:62988:229"/>
               <p n="3">3. Angels and ſouls of men are immortal <hi>per participationem,</hi> by participation; God makes them partakers of his immortality.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is an analogical mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality in Angels and the ſouls of men, though they cannot ceaſe to live, yet they may ceaſe to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and to live miſerably to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The damnation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels is a kind of death; ſo the damned ſouls ſuffer a kind of death: Damnation is called in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>the ſecond death;</hi> it were better that ſuch ſouls did periſh as the ſouls of beaſts; and when they ceaſe to live this natural life in the body, that they did ceaſe to be.</p>

To be feared, becauſe he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can kill and make alive, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone preſerves men from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and turns men into deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The vanities of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> can neither do good nor hurt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſave nor deſtroy; they have hands but cannot ſtrike a man into deſtruction, nor pluck a man from deſtruction. When <hi>Daniel</hi> was caſt into the den of lions, the living God preſerved him from death; when his accuſers were thrown in, their Idols and golden images could not preſerve them, but the living God deſtroyed them: See what a good uſe <hi>Darius,</hi> an heathen King made of it, and what a charge he giveth; <hi>Dan. 6. 26. I make a decree, that in every dominion of my Kingdom, men tremble and fear before the God of</hi> Daniel; the reaſon followeth, <hi>for he is the living God;</hi> the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges whom we adore for God, are
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:62988:230"/> dead things; how doth he prove that God is a living God? <hi>verſ. 27. he delivereth, and reſcueth,</hi> &amp;c. therefore fear and tremble before him; the gods whom we ſerve, can neither deliver, nor reſcue, nor work ſigns and wonders; the like argument Chriſt uſeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us to fear God, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a living God, he can deſtroy both body and ſoul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is the onely true God to be worſhipped, becauſe a living God, and therefore can hear, help, and ſave all ſuch as worſhip him in ſpirit and truth; men ſhew no greater madneſs in the world, nor do more un-man themſelves, then in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead <hi>ſtocks</hi> and <hi>ſtones,</hi> who have carved hands, but are dead hands and cannot ſave; have carved ears, but are dead and cannot hear; ſuch were the gods of the Heathen; and to adore dead ſtocks, was the fruit of their blind Religion; and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts that pretend to know the true

Is God a living God? then commit your lives to him in well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing; truſt the eternal living God with your mortal lives, and fear not the rage and malice of evil men, for they cannot take away your lives from you, unleſs God permit them; not an hair ſhall fall from your head without his knowledge, then much leſs ſhall a drop of your blood fall, much leſs a limb ſhall be cut off from your bodies; much leſs ſhall they take away your lives from you, if the living God will keep them and preſerve them; See <hi>Davids</hi> practice in a time when his enraged Enemies conſulted to take away his life from him; <hi>They deviſed to take away my life, but I truſted in thee O Lord; I
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:62988:231"/> ſaid, thou art my God, my times are in thy hand, deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 31. 13, 14, 15. all our times are in the hands of the living God; our time of life, the continuance and length of it; our time of death, the manner, moment, and inſtrument of it, all is in the hands of the living God; thy life and death are not in thine enemies hands, they cannot take away thy life at their pleaſure; wherefore commit thy life to God, and fear not the rage of enemies. Should we at any time forſake God to pleaſe men, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life, and betake our ſelves to ſinful ſhifts, it may fall out to us, as Chriſt foretold; <hi>He that ſaves his life ſhall loſe it, and he that loſeth his life for Chriſts ſake ſhall ſave it,</hi> even this natural life, or the eternal life of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul. Therefore if ye will have us to dye, let us not be much
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:62988:231"/> troubled, but be ready to give up our lives into the hands of the <hi>living God,</hi> and if he will have us dye, <hi>we can but dye;</hi> as the Leapers ſaid at the gate of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, the living God can give us a better life,</hi> and if the Lord will, he can deliver us from death. The three Children were more regardful of their duty to God, then of their lives, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. this was the ſum, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God would deliver them, or not deliver them, they were not anxiouſly careful, they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſerve God, but careleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſaving of their lives: Better it were that the fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace ſhould conſume their lives, then that the fire of Hell ſhould conſume their ſouls.</p>

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:62988:232"/> may confide in any creature, then may we put confidence in Princes, becauſe they are great and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they are Gods on earth, and can afford the beſt aid and help to men in diſtreſ yet conſider that in <hi>Pſa. 146. 3, 4, 5. Put not your trust in Princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom there is no help.</hi> Princes, though they are great in power, yet they are the Sons of men, and obnoxious to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition of mankind; they are vain, mortal, they dye and periſh, and when they dye all their thoughts periſh; all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, plots, deſigns and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes to do men good, dye with them, and their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites are left to ſhift for themſelves. Then the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. breaks forth into admiration of ſuch a man, who maketh God his help, his aid, his confidence and hope; he is a living God, he cannot dye, he is a great God, and his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:62988:232"/> is a living greatneſ and none of all Gods thoughts periſh, but they endure from one genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another; if we muſt not put confidence in Princes, then much leſs are we to truſt in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riches, in uncertain honours, in in Houſes and Lands, for theſe are all dead things, and more vain, and leſs able to help then man; when riches are gone and periſh, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God will and can aid us; all the creatures are by fits, but ſo many dead dogs before the living God.</p>

               <p>This likewiſe may teach the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all their dead and dull tempers of heart, whether to go for life and motion, <hi>ſc.</hi> to the living God, in whom, as all naturally live, move, and have their being; ſo the Saints in him have their ſpiritual being, life and motion. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayeth nine times, in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 119. that God would quicken him; as who ſhould ſay, my heart is dead, my prayers are dead and lazy, I have no heart to any good; but thou who art the living God canſt quicken me, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive me, and enlarge my heart, and make me to run the way of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. Therefore in all your deadeſt frames be more frequent in prayer, do not give over becauſe thou findeſt not thy heart ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. It is reported of that holy Martyr Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> that when
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:62988:234"/> he went about any duty, he would never give over, till he found ſome reviving from God; if he confeſſed his ſins, he would confeſs till he found his heart melting and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; if he prayed for pardon, he would ſtill beg for pardon, till he found his heart ſomewhat eaſed of his ſins; in praying for grace, he would never give over till he found his heart warmed in prayer; go then and do likewiſe, in all thy dead frames, importune the living God till he doth revive thy ſpirit.</p>
